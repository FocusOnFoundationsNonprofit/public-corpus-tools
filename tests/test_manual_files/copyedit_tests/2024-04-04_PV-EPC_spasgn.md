Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [2:21](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=141)
I think we can hear ourselves on the speaker. I think, anyone out there that could hear us?

Selena Brown (WFPD Public Education)  [2:26](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=146)
We can hear you.

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [2:28](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=148)
Fantastic. Thank you.

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [5:40](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=340)
All right. Good morning, everybody. It is 08:00. Let's bring the Emergency preparedness committee meeting to order. That is agenda item one. And item two, let's make sure we have a quorum. We do, we have nine of the 10 members here, but let's go through. 

Various  [5:56](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=356)
Dale? Here. Good. Lynn? Here. Craig? Here. Marianne? Not present. And she said she wouldn't make it. Chris I'm here. Ray, Jerry, Vic, Bud, Randy. 

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [6:14](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=374)
Excellent. As I said, nine of the 10, it's a good day despite the weather. Next on the agenda is oral communications for items not on the agenda. Wow. Does anyone else have a copy of the agenda that I could look at? My computer is just decided to freeze up. Thank you, sir. That's despite having downloaded a PDF copy before I got here. Wouldn't require the network. That didn't solve the problem. All right. Oral communications. Oral communications, items that are not on the agenda. Anybody on the committee? Anybody in the public? I don't see any hand raises. All right. Moving on to the next, which is to review and approve the minutes from the last meeting that were attached. Discussion, any changes? All right. All in favor? Aye. Aye. Do we have any abstentions? No, writing them doesn't cause you to abstain. Usually, people abstain if they weren't present at the meeting. Any nays? Excellent. And by the way, thank you for your minutes. They're really good. Really good. Yeah. And they capture, capture the essence without being overly wordy or anything like that. Really nice. Thank you very much. All right. Item number five. We don't have any guests today. Oh, Salina's on. Excellent. Well, item five is a discussion of the evacuation plan status. And let me just say a couple of words before we get there because we had hoped to actually have a version that had gone once more around, to have our subcommittee and the fire department, fire marshal kind of work out whatever the last details were. But I understand there's a lot of things came up on the schedule. So it didn't happen. We're not quite there. I will add that I met with, I met with Sharif, the town manager, and we had a long discussion about it. He's, I was very impressed by the meeting. We had, we just had a good, we had a good talk. He made an hour. It's time for me to go through that particular item and other emergency preparedness issues. Seemed very committed to it, committed to reading the final product before our meeting so that he could give us comments on it, but then it wasn't ready. So we weren't able to deliver the version to him to comment on. As far as I know, that's where we are. I would add that both he and I have read it in its current form. And I think the wording we agreed on is we don't see any red flags. So, that is a background. I think we have a bell you're you're heading that subcommittee and we're working to get, get it resolved and agreed upon. What can you bring us up to date on?

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [9:55](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=595)
Yeah, the plan was to try and have it by this meeting, but it's in the Fire Marshal's court right now. She did get information from flame mapper for the TRAs and she got some other information but she was out last week at the the woo we fire days in Reno and she's on vacation this week and she is also, I'm sure many of you are aware of working diligently with the new fire codes. So those took up a huge amount of her time because it went for the fire board last week that consumed all of her time. She apologizes, but we will get it done. The other thing is in your pack of the day is something the Geologic Safety Committee that she also needs to put in as an appendix to the evacuation plan. So she's got that. So there are a few things just to wrap up that before she feels comfortable presenting the final evacuation plan. I think it's still on track. So we'll have it next meeting.

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [10:57](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=657)
So that's the plan is to get there before the next meeting, right? So the review and approval expected in May, that seems like it's on track.

Vic Schachter (EPC)  [11:07](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=667)
Yep. Is that by us?

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [11:09](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=669)
By us, yeah.

Vic Schachter (EPC)  [11:11](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=671)
The next procedural step is us at the next meeting and then hopefully that it's approved then submitting it to the town council. 

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [11:19](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=679)
Correct.

Vic Schachter (EPC)  [11:22](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=682)
And then what was that in terms of doing that in conjunction with the town manager and staff, was that anticipated that would be a collective presentation or that would be us knowing they're supportive. What's kind of the procedural strategy?

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [11:42](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=702)
The discussions that I've been part of suggest that the author probably be presented, but it would come from the fire department to the town council. So we'd have a fire marshal. Oh really? I believe so. That's not up to us to decide if she were here, she would say, but that's what I understand from conversations.

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [12:03](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=723)
We will check on that and we'll, we have our next meeting with our liaison and the fire marshal because early on, certainly Craig Taylor was pretty adamant that this had to come from staff. But it doesn't matter to me personally where it comes from as long as it gets to the town council.

Vic Schachter (EPC)  [12:23](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=743)
Right, I would agree with that with the staff or with the representation staff has had an adequate opportunity to review it and therefore supports it. I think that would be very helpful to the positive reception to the town council. Excellent that's great.

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [12:45](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=765)
Yep and I should probably also make clear that I did discuss with our liaison, whether he needed to be here he had a schedule conflicts, and I felt that since we weren't moving to a recommendation today. It was fine for him to go to his other obligation.

Randy True (EPC)  [13:04](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=784)
Chris. Dale, on a procedural. Just question. I mean last year I think we will we did do the special meeting prior to then voting on it in a regular meeting. Do we need to do that? Was that just something you decided to do last year to expedite it because people hadn't seen the draft at all yet? I don't recall.

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [13:23](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=803)
The reason we did it last year was to try and expedite it. To get it done before fire season. At this point, I think we're OK if we can get it approved at next meeting.

Randy True (EPC)  [13:34](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=814)
So just procedurally it's fine to present it at the same meeting and we vote on it? 

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [13:38](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=818)
Yes. And I think Jerry you had a comment?

Jerry Shefren (EPC Vice Chair)  [13:41](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=821)
Yeah. Is there in the plan a actual implementation schedule? I mean it's one thing to have the council prove it. It's another thing to have them implement it. And I'm particularly interested in the widening of Alpine Road, which I think is gonna be a pretty important part of being able to evacuate on time. And that's gonna take some years to get done. And if you don't start it soon, the process and find the money and so on you know will be 10 years from now you know with a plan without you know some key things so I just wondered is there going to be anything in the plan that sort of obligates the town to start an implementation process or?

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [14:37](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=877)
The answer is no. The plan and and this is very specific and the reason that essentially it was rewritten from the one that you approved last year, this plan is written primarily for the first responders and town officials to implement an evacuation. It has nothing to do with improving infrastructure or anything else. Those, if you remember, Jerry, and I'm going to talk about that in a few minutes, were in the original study from Fehr and Peers where they had all sorts of recommendations and Vic has talked to the town council about that. That's a completely separate issue than the evacuation plan. The evacuation plan is simply something the first responders look at and say, if we have to evacuate, here's the chain of command. This is what has to be done. And so on.

Vic Schachter (EPC)  [15:33](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=933)
I just want to refresh everybody. You may recall we provided some rankings to the town council some time ago from that report and among the high priorities was the widening of that road. We're recognizing that this is going to take some approval from other entities. I have not given the drinking water from a fire hose posture that the town manager has been in, pressed further on it. If the committee wishes me to do so, I'm happy to inquire where that stands and see whether there's any readiness to readdress that issue among the other rankings which have been provided high, medium, and low. But that is right now it's dormant but it's still there as an action item apart from the evacuation plant.

Jerry Shefren (EPC Vice Chair)  [16:27](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=987)
I think it behooves this committee to intermittently be asking the town where are we you know.

Vic Schachter (EPC)  [16:37](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=997)
I'll be happy to do that.

Jerry Shefren (EPC Vice Chair)  [16:39](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=999)
We did our job and it's over now and now we're done because I don't think that's the case.

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [16:46](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1006)
Right, question. In the widening is just in Portola Valley or does that include the direct because that's county. How do we tie the whole thing together always to a widening.

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [17:02](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1022)
Well, the remember the fair and peers report was a was a recommendation. There's there's no without knowing the politics, the consultant can't come in and tell you how to get this done. And the issue with the county is a long and complicated story, but and it's probably too long to go into here. But those discussions certainly with the changeover to administration here and so on, I think have have almost ceased. But it's something that this committee ought to recommend to council that they should begin to move on.

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [17:39](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1059)
But my area is out of our jurisdiction.

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [17:43](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1063)
Yes it is. 

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [17:43](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1063)
But that County should get involved sooner because that's even greater bottleneck than we are.

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [17:48](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1068)
But the discussion started some years ago. They came up with a conclusion to put roundabouts in. And the Fair and Peer study showed definitively those are a really bad idea for evacuation. They actually cause more problems than they solve in an evacuation.

Bud Trapp (EPC Chair)  [18:06](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1086)
Especially with fire engines, they're bigger than roundabout has to be huge. 

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [18:10](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1090)
Yeah. Well, I think the opportunity here is to get the evacuation plan through. And I think in discussions, like I said, Sharif, our town manager, was very open, spent some time with me. I'm sure we will do that again Vic I know you have a channel as well I think we bring it up and we asked you know where is it in their priority list in doing that, making them aware that you think it's something that ought to be considered next.

Vic Schachter (EPC)  [18:37](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1117)
So if of the committee, I will contact Sharif and refresh the discussion on the rankings and act in a supportive way to moving our evacuation plan forward to preparation. And is it anticipated that we will get that if the approval to the next meeting, we'll be able to get the recommendation to the town council at the following town council meeting? Is that what you hope to do?

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [19:08](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1148)
I think that's in general what is hoped to be done. I don't have a firm commitment from anyone that it will be on the very next meeting or something like that, but I think everyone feels that we're near the end and would like to get it through.

Vic Schachter (EPC)  [19:20](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1160)
Right. The only reason I raised that is whether you need to get it on the agenda for the next town council meeting following our action our next meeting whether something needs to be done to do that. I don't know what the mechanics are of that, but I would encourage us, optimistically speaking, I would encourage us to anticipate a positive response at our next meeting to the evacuation study and then simultaneously trying to schedule this on the next town council meeting. I think that would be highly desirable.

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [19:56](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1196)
Well, again, to give the town manager a lot of credit, he also followed up with me saying, where's the report? I want to read it. I want to make sure I'm ready. So, I think first, let's get it headed to a readable point. Then, we'll get it to him in that conversation. When I hand it over, I ask how how is the best way to get it on the agenda as soon as possible. 

Randy True (EPC)  [20:19](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1219)
Another question. So, council member Craig Taylor, our former liaison, he had the comments to the old one like there's 51 comments, some of which were minor and I'm sure are irrelevant now for the new one, but some of which were made more major sort of technical things like errors in the evacuation maps. Has that has that list of his comments have been gone through and...

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [20:48](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1248)
I don't know the answer to that okay.

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [20:50](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1250)
I have not reached out to Craig Taylor

Randy True (EPC)  [20:53](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1253)
I guess I'm asking if either of y'all have done it.

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [20:55](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1255)
I haven't. I haven't addressed those you can send those to me I'll see if there's anything I can do.

Randy True (EPC)  [21:03](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1263)
I can. I can try to do that in the second half of this month because after the meeting of the two subcommittees, Aalfs and Taylor and us last year, I did go through, I spent five or six hours that next morning going through all them and replying?

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [21:18](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1278)
Is it Jeff? Yes, our liaison is Jeff Aalfs but I get just being practical. If If we remember that there were some issues that Craig Taylor had, we should probably just reach out and make sure that they're addressed. Yeah. And we're just trying to grease the skids here. We don't, we don't want to find a last minute. Yeah.

Jerry Shefren (EPC Vice Chair)  [21:37](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1297)
So I think either they'll, or I can reach out to you.

Vic Schachter (EPC)  [21:41](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1301)
And I do remind you, I met with Craig at his home in some detail about all of this and my recollection is his outstanding concern was procedurally making sure the town council, the staff had an opportunity to provide input and it was his strong recommendation that the approval of the evacuation plan should definitely come at least as a bilateral both for our committee and the town council excuse me and the staff to the town council and that was highly desirable from his perspective That was certainly more dominant than any of the remaining concerns that we talked about.

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [22:23](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1343)
I think it's a good reminder. And I think one or both of us will reach out to Craig. Excellent. So there are two other pieces. I think I mentioned this at the last meeting, but in case I didn't to get it out in front of everybody, I was contacted by the head of the Geologic Safety Committee that they had provided a map of geologic hazards and it is attached to this month's packet. And that has been approved by their committee. What he related to me was that Fire Marshal Kim would like this attached as an appendix to the evacuation plan and so it is presented here for everyone to see and have a look at. I don't know that we have any action items, but if anyone has a comment or question about it, put me open to it. Get some concrete, right? A little bit of epoxy, a little bit of concrete and we can delete this appendix. Okay. Appreciate that comment. I'm looking to see if there's any comments from the public. I don't see any hands raised on Zoom. Okay. And then item D, the evaluation study, which is a spell check of evacuation study. And so Dale has been trained, well I'll let Dale tell us, but he's been trained in the software to look at the evacuation of the town. And I think you have some results to share.

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [24:17](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1457)
Yeah, it's attached to the memo. I think it's very timely and important. If you remember, we got the town to pay for an evacuation capacity study by Fair and Peers a couple of years ago. It was a fairly extensive, massive study. There's a link to it. Everybody ought to reread that. It tells you that essentially we've got an evacuation problem in Portola Valley. That should come as no surprise. We only have two ways in and out. If one of them gets blocked, it gets significantly worse. In that report are a series of recommendations to improve evacuation times. I also give you the page numbers of where those are out. Those are the ones that Vic mentioned. This plan, the the Ferr and Peers document, we did not include any new housing from the housing element. We use only the existing housing and population of Portola Valley. Subsequent to that, Woodside Fire actually introduced the EPC to the small company called Ladris, which does have a cloud based software program to facilitate evacuation planning. Several members, volunteers spent a lot of time with Lagos. I cannot tell you how many hours they spent essentially debugging the program, working on user interface, fixing the databases, and so on. And Rob really hit that up, and there were several times he was convinced that they would never get there. But eventually by diligently working, they have got a pretty good product. And the first step we used to say if it was valid is we put in the same parameters that they're in peer use and got roughly the same result of the evacuation time. You have to remember that all of these evacuation studies are proprietary. Everybody's is a little bit different on how they model things statistically and so on, so you can never expect exactly the same result. But they're pretty close. So we use that as the baseline, and then we actually input cars for the new housing, and ran the simulations for all roads open, or total road block, Arastradero and Alpine block. And, you know, it kind of passes the smell test. With all the roads are open, you increase the number of cars by like an inner 20%. And the evacuation times increase some. You mainly increase by 30 minutes or something. As soon as you block a road, they increase a lot and particularly if you block Alpine and and Portola. And again, no surprise on this. The real thing here and a lot of people want to look at well, it's average or median. We really want people to focus on maximum because that tells you how long it's going to take to get everybody out of Portola Valley if there's an evacuation. And it's somewhat frightening. Alpine and Portola are blocked. It's about five hours with all the new houses. What does that tell you? Again, we know we have an evacuation problem. There it is in black and white. We now have a license to run Ladris, both Woodside Fire and Portola Valley have that license. I don't think anybody in town staff currently is trained to use it. And I know Don Bullard was the last one, the fire department who was trained to use Ladris. But I'm fairly comfortable running the thing right now. So it's not necessarily 100% intuitive, but we can change parameters. We can add cars, we can change the evacuation times, we can change blockages. So it's fairly useful from that standpoint to get an idea how long it's gonna take to evacuate various points. I think the point of this full exercise from at least from my standpoint is we have an evacuation problem. Let's get moving on the mitigation efforts like Jerry mentioned, widening Alpine Road, you know, maybe getting a crew to take care of, you know, downed power poles. I don't know if people are aware, but in the Paradise Fire, downed power poles that burned and fell over were a serious problem and led to a significant number of deaths because they just couldn't get by them. So those are the kinds of things that from a mitigation standpoint, we really, really need to get moving. And with that, I'm open to discussion. And I would like this committee, if you approve this report, I think we need to send it off to the ASCC and the planning commission and probably other safety committees and the town council. So people are at least aware of the magnitude of problem. So questions, thoughts, discussion.

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [29:40](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1780)
I couldn't make out the pretty pictures in the back.

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [29:45](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1785)
Oh, those are just the output of the runs. When you run the simulation, this is what the thing spits out for you.

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [29:50](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1790)
But the pictures don't look differently they're really they're so small it's hard for anyone to understand you about them

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [29:57](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1797)
You know the pictures don't really tell you anything all it's like the final it shows you all the properties of an evacuating.

Jerry Shefren (EPC Vice Chair)  [30:09](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1809)
And I'm not sure why you chose that process. I mean, why did you do that? ASCC and the [unintelligible] commission, if it's an evacuation process, or not, not clearly?

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [30:31](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1831)
Well, I mean, this committee can choose to not send it anywhere.

Jerry Shefren (EPC Vice Chair)  [30:34](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1834)
No, I'm not saying not send it anywhere. I'm just saying, does it need to go through those committees? What is...

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [30:40](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1840)
No, no, I think it's just an informational.

Jerry Shefren (EPC Vice Chair)  [30:42](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1842)
Oh, OK. We're not asking them. 

Dale Pfau (EPC)  [30:43](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1843)
Oh, we don't. No, changes or no. If they want to learn how to run the program, they can run their own. So I just I think this is an important thing that people need to be aware of. And people in the planning process in this town should be aware of. I'm afraid that because it's two years old, people have even forgot about the fair and appears report.

Jerry Shefren (EPC Vice Chair)  [31:10](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1870)
My biggest fear is that the actual mitigations and the ability to evacuate most residents a significant number is five to 10 years. You know, just I can't, the way things move here, it's very hard to see that concrete steps would be taken. Now, maybe I'm just old and irritable and skeptical, but as I kind of look at what's been going on.

Chris Raanes (EPC Chair)  [31:44](https://youtu.be/WGbtmP4uWvo&t=1904)
We can take a committee vote on that.
