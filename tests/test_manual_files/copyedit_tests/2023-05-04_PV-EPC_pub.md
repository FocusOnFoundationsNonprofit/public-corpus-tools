Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [7:31](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=451)
Okay. Great. So we now have a quorum. It's 8 oâ€™clock in the morning. We are going to go ahead and get started now that we will, so I'll go all our technical issues. Thank you, Howard. Okay. Meeting is called the order. Let's do a quick roll call. And I see.

Various  [7:54](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=474)
Dave Howes. Marianne? Yeah. Chris. Ray Rothrock? Yeah. Jerry? Vic? Yes here. Rob? Here.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [8:16](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=496)
And Randy, you're in the audience, like, unfortunately, can't count you as a, as being here, except in the audience.

Rob Younge (EPC)  [8:25](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=505)
He's got COVID. Unfortunately.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [8:28](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=508)
Are you positive for COVID, Randy?

Randy True (EPC)  [8:31](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=511)
I am. Yes. My whole family is, and have been for a week. It's been a tough go. I've had no symptoms, but.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [8:42](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=522)
Chris, I see you. Bud, you could make it. Thank you for participating. You're here. You just can't vote, but it's wonderful to see you. Okay. Oral communication. Do we have any oral communications from anybody out there that would like to speak? Bud.

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [9:02](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=542)
I have a question. But when, is it of interest to us about the fire maps from the Fire Department of Portola Valley? When do they come out?

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [9:14](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=554)
When the new ones come out? We will probably review them at least in subcommittee and may bring them to full committee. Yeah.

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [9:22](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=562)
Do you have any idea when that might happen?

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [9:25](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=565)
No. 

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [9:26](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=566)
Has the Fire District said anything?

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [9:28](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=568)
They have released a preliminary fire map with what's called Firemapper, but it had considerable number of problems with preliminary area maps, and so they are working through that. When are they going to get then to us? I don't know.

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [9:45](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=585)
Thank you.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [9:47](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=587)
Any other oral communication? Okay. I just have just a couple of quick ones. I want to thank all of you who helped with the booth, communications trailer, this past week in the Wildfire Preparedness Day, particular shout out to Ray, who got the trailer working and to Jerry, who volunteered to drive it up and back in my days. That was a huge effort. So thank you, Jerry, and we have a great participation in committee. Thank you all very much for that. The next thing is, I want to shout out to our subcommittee system, which is working really well. A lot of progress and things coming up. In particular, on the Evac Subcommittee, I think Rob Younge, in particular, has made more progress in the last month on the Evacuation Plan than we probably have in 18 months. And I know Randy is getting involved there with schools in particular, so thank you very, hopefully, if you saw Rob's note, by June 1st, we're going to have something out for public comment or an Evacuation Plan. So that is huge. Okay. With that, we are going to go ahead and proceed if you all noticed, I'm sure you did on the agenda. I moved the Town Report and Fire Department Reports up because we have missed those the last couple of meetings because they were later, and we had so many other things going. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to the Town Report and, apparently, Corie was going to give us an update on the internet, and I know Howard is here to talk about the AM radio. And then Craig will talk about the AM radio signs. So our, if that was not working. Oh, I'm sorry. I skipped that over, we're going to go back right now.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [11:51](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=711)
Minutes. Again, thank you Lynn so much. We're in great minutes. Do I have? All in favor? Great. Thank you. Unanimous approval. Really good. Thank you all so much. Okay. Now do we have Howard who can speak to us?

Howard Young (Interim Town Manager)  [12:33](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=753)
Okay. Thank you. And I know our communications, I didn't, I wanted to add one thing. I wanted everyone to introduce everyone to Justin Bixby on our maintenance crew here. Part of it is as I wanted to just having an opportunity to show the faces of Public Works. Right? Right now, it's just me and two maintenance folks, and really, in an emergency, you're likely to see me and Justin and likely Scott too. So I just wanted to introduce everyone to Justin Bixby. He's been with us for how long, Justin? Seven years. So works on the buildings, trails, and your parks too. So thank you very much. So let's see. The first item here is concerning the internet options for backup internet. So Corie is not here, but she provided me some written comments to provide. So what we're looking at is, right now, our main internet provider is Comcast right now, and we're looking into the, Corie is looking into switching that to AT&T Fiber. And then the backup, they're looking into some type of satellite backup. Don't know if it's as going to be Starlink or Viasat. Whoever the vendor is going to be, I think they're looking at cost and what the infrastructure is right now. So internally between Corie and IT, they are deciding. So is that enough information?

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [14:10](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=850)
Yeah.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [14:16](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=856)
I took it out of the box this week and plugged it in and it worked. I didn't do anything. It hunted the satellites. It did everything. And I had 93 megabits download. Five network sync. So there's 3000 satellites up there now. There's 12000 authorized. So there'll be no dead spots in the sky. From a simplicity point of view, and go online and read about different services and organizations that are using, and I would strongly urge [inaudible]. I don't know what it will cost the Town. Dale, report 100 bucks every 20 bucks a month. That's what fiber costs at my house. 150 bucks a month. Unbelievable. It reminds me of Macintosh in 1984. You plug it in and it works. I'm a tech guy and I was looking forward to digging in. But I plugged it in and it just works.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [15:30](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=930)
To add to that. I've had Starlink a little over a year now. I use it. I primarily got it as a backup to another internet connection I have that goes out. Starlink never goes out. As long as you've got power, it's going to be there. So even AT&T Fiber goes out occasionally and they lose power. And, again, we a delay time, latency, much better with Starlink than any of the other satellite systems. Again, this committee strongly recommends to start it. So okay. Let's go on, Howard.

Howard Young (Interim Town Manager)  [16:09](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=969)
Thank you for that input. Okay. Let's see. Next on the item is the update on the Cal Water site. So let me go back a little bit. So a while ago, I was asked to basically install the antenna up at the Cal Water site. And as the, what I'm going to ultimately get at is, Cal Water has a concern with placing a facility there. And I want to go backwards as to how to, just some ministry on how this occurred. So I was told, basically, to get the antenna out there. So I started getting quotes. And what it looks like is up on Peak and Cervantes. There's a tank that area that they own. It's a plot of land. And the thought process was, number one, I was asked to, there was a meeting. I was not involved at that meeting, but there was a meeting and this was agreed to. So by the time I got into is, basically, just get some quotes. So I was just getting some quotes and then also to test the internet, the phone lines there too. So we were using the phone lines that existed on the property already from Cal Water. So that took some time to coordinate. So and then we, Ray, thanks a lot for the drawings. They, basically, the equipment and the drawings. The drawings consisted, I think, was a hundred feet or trenching from the box to an open area, and then an antenna pull with an antenna and the grounding plane. So as we were going through the contracts with the Cal Water, they were asking for more and more information, deep details, and then engineering drawings too. So we slowly started submitting those things. And then once it got to their engineering department, Don Smith then said, "Hey. Wait a second. You know, this is not what we kind of, what she envisioned." For some reason, and I don't know what happened in the past. She envisioned, "Oh, it was supposed to be an antenna mounted to the side of a tank to a handrail," and she didn't think there was a big deal. So now that she's looked at it, she was concerned of neighbors because about 10 years ago, there was a proposal to put a cell site up there. And the neighbors, there was a lot of publicity and concern from the neighbors, and the cell site got shut down. And so they're, then she turned to me and goes, "Oh, did anyone check?" Because number one, we're concerned about the scope of work, but did anyone check with the neighbors. And it turns out that no one has checked with the neighbors yet to install this or have this facility there. So in speaking with Don, she has a huge concern that, you know, they said that they're doing this to help the Town. They didn't want any bad publicity out of it. What are we going to do to basically check with the neighbors? And then also the concern about the scope came up too. So, you know, where do we go from here? Is probably the question. I'm trying to come up with some ideas, and we'll probably have to work with Dale and Ray to come up with some ideas also. As to ultimately where it goes, how we're going to proceed. I had a couple ideas of, well, maybe we put the poll and antenna in the right of way there. And then just have the equipment, the radio equipment on their property. That's one option, but that does not solve the neighborhood up, the neighborhood issue that we have to do and who does that. The other option is finding a spot of Town land that's acceptable to put it at. And so some of my thoughts are, and once again, this is their initial without visiting the site, but, you know, we have a high spot over there on, over La Honda and Skyline. We own a piece of land there that's high. So that may or may not work. But I don't know how, we have to think about what are the next steps. You know, what are our options right now knowing that Cal Water is not really favored in this huge structure on their land right now. So I'm open for input and discussion on how to resolve this. Thank you.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [20:43](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1243)
Okay. Well, I think Ray and I, and probably Chris, will work with you to find the appropriate future. We like the city right away. Very much. So we'll get back to that. Okay, Ray?

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [21:03](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1263)
Yeah. That's true. There's just some considerations. You know, when you put an antenna like this, you put a full antenna. It looks just like the one that's out here. It radiates in all directions. And I've been thinking about that place of an old La Honda. So that's well north to the full route. So you're going to be radiating way further north, that's not relevant to us, and possibly over the hill, which is growing. And this is 10 watts AM. So it decays from a stream point very quickly. The reason why it is where it is, is because it's in central Portola Valley and it radiates beautifully all over people about hitting some of the nooks and valleys that are around. So as I think about it, I'm sure it would work for some of Portola Valley up at La Honda. But I wouldn't want to be sitting at the end of Los Trancos and expect people to hear it like they can hear it now. So we haven't tested that. That's just, you know, you got to think about the terrain and distance in our, let's fill that out.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [22:14](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1334)
We'll work with you Howard.

Howard Young (Interim Town Manager)  [22:16](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1336)
Yeah. Thank you. And I know that, you know, we originally placed the antenna site here at Town Center, and there were probably some concerns. But maybe in this whole discussion, what to do with that site also, the existing post that's out there right now. So thank you very much. And once again, you know, on behalf of the Town, I apologize if there's any, it was, you know, obviously, there was some delay. Obviously, there's some kind of communications between the Town and, like, Cal Water that happened, that basically they didn't ultimate the, their top didn't ultimately know what the final project is going to be. So, hopefully, we can move forward and find a solution. Thank you.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [23:14](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1394)
I was just asking if the committee could reach out to the neighbors to get a sense of whether they'd be okay with an AM antenna.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [23:24](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1404)
I'm sure they can, but it's not my job. It's ASCC's job. And...

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [23:30](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY?t=1410)
It's not ASCC's job for sure. 

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [23:32](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY?t=1412)
Okay. Then who's job is it?

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [23:33](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1413)
Well, that's why I'm, Ray, that's why I'm asking.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [23:36](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1416)
Well, I'm not knocking on [inaudible]... 

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [23:40](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1420)
Okay. So you're part of the Emergency Preparedness Committee. And one of the things, no, no. You just, you asked me a question. Do you want an answer? Or you or you just want to tell me, so it's not your job, but I think it could well be the committee's job. So it may not be your job.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [23:53](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1433)
Yep. We'll figure that out.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [24:00](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1440)
Okay. Craig, AM radio signs.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [24:09](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1449)
So the Mayor and I talked about the signs, and probably the best thing is that, we'll, at some point, agendize it with the ASCC. Dale and I have talked about a couple of different possibilities, I mean, what I would recommend is that you guys come up with your three favorite. And then after we get through the housing element and stuff, then we can agendize it with ASCC and to be able to move that forward.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [24:38](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1478)
Okay. I think we have our three favorites already, but I will forward those on to you. Well, you know, this committee has, all we can do is offer some suggestions, there were 2 versions in the last packet. And since you have another one in the past, we can forward all those on the ASCC. Ultimately, it's their decision. All we are doing is recommending signs, which are very important.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [25:13](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1513)
I guess the question I was asking is whether the committee had a discussion about the different signs. The ASCC is going to bring it to sort of a public hearing, so to speak. But I think having this committee discuss the issues. I mean, one of the issues that I don't fully understand. And, right, you might have been involved about FCC saying that this is TIS and it's not for emergency. And so, like, exactly what can we put on that sign and, you know, are there issues with what we put on the sign? Relative to the FCC. So I think we need all that stuff resolved before it gets to the ASCC. Otherwise, I think this is just going to go around in the loop. And then I think it'd be interesting for this committee to weigh in on signs. I mean, particularly, this sign, you know, the signs that you and I have talked about have been sort of these blue signs. They're going to be issues. People are going to have issues with signage. I mean, there's always somebody in the Town who's had issues with signage. So I think making sure you guys have sort of full discussion on it for a while rather than just work at the ASCC. My guess is it'll just go around in circles up there. So the more you guys can get lined up before it goes to ASCC the better.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [26:25](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1585)
This committee has discussed this at the length. I'm actually getting pretty tired of just continual pushback from Town.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [26:32](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1592)
Great. Then Dale, then you should just submit it. And if it goes around in circles, then we will go around circles. But I've given you my advice, but I'm not here to tell you can, you guys can do what you want to do. I'm giving you my advice.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [26:46](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1606)
That we've already done it. We voted three years ago.

Jerry Shefren (EPC)  [26:54](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1614)
My mind isn't quite five percent. I think it might be worthwhile to just bring forward again. We have the goals.

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [27:05](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1625)
Refresh our minds.

Marianne Plunder (EPC)  [27:07](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1627)
Yeah. A number of us weren't on the committee three years ago.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [27:12](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1632)
Okay.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [27:16](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1636)
OK. Next. 

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [27:18](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1638)
But I have a question though. I'd go back. We talked about the antenna. Ray, do you have a the antenna at your place right now? 

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [27:25](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1645)
Yeah, I do.

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [27:26](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1646)
Did you get the neighbor's approval? 

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [27:28](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1648)
No.

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [27:30](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1650)
Okay. So, but we do need to have the...

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [27:33](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1653)
The reason why I bring up the neighbors thing and the ASCC's approval because previous Town Manager, when Dale and I were up there marking this out and getting the quotes and doing the homework for it, that it wouldn't have to pass it through ASCC. It is on with a piece of property [inaudible]. So my job was to get all the technical stuff together, get a look at the ground, and I did. What Howard got was over, and he could know that it like, he wasn't part of that conversation. That's why I think it's an ASCC thing. [inaudible] That was quite a process.

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [28:15](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1695)
I remember that.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [28:21](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1701)
Okay. Onto the Fire Department, and we moved you guys up because we haven't heard from you in a couple of months. So I see both Selena and Chief are on the line. Either one of you would like to go ahead and give us a quick update.

Rob Lindner (Fire Chief)  [28:38](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1718)
Sure. Good morning, everybody. Just an FYI it was talked about in the first part when you guys are talking. And what I'm noticing, if you are not right on the mic, we and the public cannot hear you at all. Howard's microphone was fantastic. Craig's was good, but the second you guys start to talk to each other, we can't hear anything on that side. So just FYI. But, anyway, let's say, yeah, it's been a couple of months. So weather event I gave it, gave the weather events pretty much every meeting prior to this last one. So, fortunately, we haven't had the weather events to any extreme nature that we've had. We have this one going through right now, which hasn't posed, you know, much of a problem at all other than it sounds like highway 35 now just got affected. It was closed this morning. Sounds like they have, unofficially, it sounds like they have, like, one lane open for residents to get through what they need to. But for traffic, it sounds like they've closed it. I don't have the other details, we're trying to get that information right now, but add that one to the list, unfortunately. Let's see, our station projects were back up and running full tilt until this latest rain came in, but they're progressing well. The bump back a month or so. So they're still online to be completed before the end of the year, both the construction at station seven and the remodel at station eight. Gave you the update as much as I know on Skyline. I didn't hear initially, it sounded like Bud was asking about the maps. The maps are not completed yet. Once they're completed, they will vet through us. We will advise our stakeholders have some meetings before it goes to our board for approval, then it goes to the Towns for approval after that. So it's still not there yet, but there was some reworking that they were doing based on some comments that were made when it was presented to the board, to our board of directors a couple months ago. So no specific timeline on that. The last thing I had probably heard through the grapevine a few months ago now. I submitted my retirement paperwork to our board of directors at the end of June. We've already gone through interviews, and my successor has been named. It happens to be on this meeting. So the current Deputy Fire Chief, Tom Cuschieri, has been named as my successor, the Fire Chief for the district. My last day in the office will be, I think it's, like, June 22nd, and Tom will be taking over after that as the new Fire Chief. Then we will be going through our next round of promotionals within the organization. So I was kind of giving you that at the Captain and the Battalion Chief level, and it will continue as well. So that's all I have.
