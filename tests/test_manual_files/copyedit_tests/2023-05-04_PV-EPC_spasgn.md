Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [7:31](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=451)
Okay. Great. So we now have a quorum. It's 08:00 in the morning. We are gonna go ahead and get started now that we will So I'll go all our technical issues. Thank you, Howard. Okay. Meetings called the order. Let's do a quick roll call. And I see.

Various  [7:54](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=474)
Dave Howes. Marianne? Yeah. Chris. Ray Rothrock? Yeah. Jerry? Vic? Yes here. Rob? Here.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [8:16](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=496)
And Randy, you're in the audience, like, unfortunately, can't count you as a as being here, except in the audience.

Rob Younge (EPC)  [8:25](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=505)
He's got COVID. Unfortunately.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [8:28](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=508)
Are you positive for COVID, Randy?

Randy True (EPC)  [8:31](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=511)
I am. Yes. My whole family is in and have been for a week. It's been been a tough go. I've had no symptoms, but.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [8:42](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=522)
Chris, I see you. Bud, you could make it. Thank you for participating. You're here. You just can't vote, but it's wonderful to see you. Okay. Oral communication. Do we have any oral communications from anybody out there that would like to speak? Bud.

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [9:02](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=542)
I have a question. But when it's it's a bit it's it's a bit just to us about the fire maps from the fire department. Before 12 dollars. Then we'll just come out.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [9:14](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=554)
When the new ones come out? We we will probably review them at least in September. We'll review full committing yet. Do you have any do you have any idea when that might happen?

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [9:25](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=565)
No. As a part of this, you said anything.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [9:28](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=568)
They have released a preliminary fire map with what's called Firemapper, but it had considerable number of problems with with preliminary error maps, and so they are working through that. When are they gonna get confused? I don't know.

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [9:45](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=585)
Thank you.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [9:47](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=587)
Any other oral communication? Hey. I just have just a couple of quick ones. I wanna thank all of you who helped with the booth, communications trailer, this past week in the Wildfire, preparedness day, particular shout out to Ray, who got the trailer working and to Sherry, who volunteered to drive it up and back in my days. That was a huge effort. So thank you, Jerry, and we have a great participation in committee. Thank you all very much for that. The next thing is I wanna shout out to our our sub committee system, which is working really well. A lot of progress and things coming up. In particular, on the eFax sub committee, I think Rob Young, in particular, has made more progress in the last month on the executive plan than we probably have in 18 months. And I know Randy is getting involved there with schools in particular, so thank you very, hopefully, if you saw Rob's note, by June first, we're gonna have something out for public comment or an evaluation plan. So that is that is huge. Okay. With that, we are gonna go ahead and proceed if you all noticed, I'm sure you did on the agenda. I moved the town report and fire department reports up because We have missed those the last couple of meetings because they were later, and we had so many other things going. So with that, I'm gonna turn it over to the town report and And, apparently, Corey was gonna give us an update on the Internet, and I know Howard is here to talk about the AM radio. And then Craig will talk about the AM radio signs. So our if that was not working. Oh, I'm sorry. I skipped that over we're gonna go back right now.

Speaker X  [11:51](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=711)
Minutes. Again, thank you Lynn so much.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [11:53](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=713)
We're in great minutes. Do I have all all in favor? Great. Thank you. Really good. Thank you all so much. Okay. Now do we have the power people speak to us?

Howard Young (Interim Town Manager)  [12:33](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=753)
Okay. Thank you. And I know our communications, I didn't I wanted to add one thing. Wanted everyone to introduce everyone to Justin Bixby on our maintenance crew here. Part of it is as I wanted to just having an opportunity to show the faces of public works. Right? Right now, it's just me and two maintenance folks And, really, in an emergency, you're likely to see me and Justin and likely Scott too. So I just wanted to introduce everyone to Justin Bixby. He's been with us for how long with Justin? Seven years. So what works on the buildings, trails, and your your parks too. So thank you very much. So let's see. The first item here is concerning the Internet options for backup Internet. So Corey is not here, but she provided me some written comments to provide. So what we're looking at is, right now, our main our main Internet provider is Comcast right now, and we're looking into the Corey is looking into switching that to AT and T Fiber. And then the backup, they're looking into some type of satellite backup. Don't know if it's as gonna be StarLink or via SaaS. Where whoever the vendor is gonna be, I think they're looking at cost and what the infrastructure is right now. So internally between Korean IT, they are deciding. So is that enough information?

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [14:10](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=850)
Yeah.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [14:16](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=856)
Rob Young, let me do

Speaker 3  [14:18](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=858)
a good budget. So I take most of my time. I

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [14:23](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=863)
I took it out of the box

Speaker 3  [14:25](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=865)
this week and plug it in. It didn't work.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [14:29](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=869)
Didn't do anything. It hunted the satellites. Didn't do everything. And I had 93 megabits download.

Speaker 3  [14:37](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=877)
Five network sync.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [14:41](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=881)
So there's 3000 satellites up there now. There's 12000 authorized. So there'll be more dead spots in this guy. I from a simplistic point of view and go online and read about different services and organizations that are using, and I would strongly I don't know what it will cost the town

Speaker 3  [15:03](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=903)
but they'll report 700 bucks every 20 bucks

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [15:07](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=907)
a month. That's what my fire my fiber at my house was amazing. I'm with that guy. I was looking forward to reading the And I will add

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [15:30](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=930)
to that. I've had Starlink a little over a year now. I use it. I primarily got it as a backup to another Internet connection I have that goes out. StarLink never goes out. As long as you've got power, it's gonna be there. So even AT and T Fiber goes out occasionally and they lose power.

Speaker 3  [15:48](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=948)
And, again, we

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [15:53](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=953)
a delay time, latency, much better with StarLink than any of the other satellite systems. Again, this committee strongly recommends to

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [16:04](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=964)
start it. So

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [16:07](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=967)
okay. Let's go on, Howard.

Howard Young (Interim Town Manager)  [16:09](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=969)
Thank you for that input. Okay. Let's see. Next on the item is the update on the Cal Water site. So let me let me go back a little bit. So a while ago, I was asked to basically install the antenna up at the Cal Water site. And as the what I'm gonna ultimately get at is is Cal Water has a concern with placing a facility there. And I wanna go backwards as to how to just some ministry on how this occurred. So I was told, basically, to get the antenna out there. So I started getting quotes. And what it looks like is up on peak and Cervantes. There's a tank that area that they own. It's a plot of land. And the thought process was number one, I was asked to there was a meeting. I was not involved at that meeting, but there was a meeting and this was agreed to. So by the time I got into is, basically, just get some quotes. So I was just getting some quotes and then also to test the inner the the phonemes there too. So we were using the phone lines that existed on the property already from Cal Water. So that took some time to coordinate. So and then we Ray, thanks a lot for the drawings. They basically the equipment and the drawings The drawings consisted, I think, was a hundred feet or trenching from the box to an open area, and then an antenna pull with an antenna and the grounding plane. So as we were going through the contracts with the Cal Water, they were asking for more and more information, deep details, and then engineering drawings too. So we slowly started submitting those things. And then once it got to their engineering department, Don Smith then said, hey. Wait a second. You know, this is not what we kind of what what she envisioned. For some reason, and I don't know what happened in the past. She envisioned, oh, it was supposed to be an antenna mounted to the side of a tank. To a handrail, and she didn't think there was AAA big deal. So now that she's looked at it, she was concerned of Neighbors because about 10 years ago, there was a proposal to put a cell site up there. And the neighbors, there was a there was a there was a lot of publicity and and concern from the neighbors, and the cell site got shut down. And so they're they then turned she turned turned to me and goes, oh, did anyone check? Because number one, we're concerned about the scope of work, but did anyone check with the neighbors. And it turns out that no one has checked with the neighbors yet to install this or have this facility there. So In speaking with Don, she has a huge concern that, you know, she they said that, you know, that they're They're doing this to help the town. They didn't want any bad publicity out of it. What are we gonna do to basically check with the neighbors? And then also the concern about the scope came up too. So, you know, where where do we go from here? Is probably the question. I'm I'm trying to come up with some ideas, and we'll probably have to work with Dale and Ray to come up with some ideas also. As to ultimately where it goes, how we're gonna proceed. I had a couple ideas of well, maybe we put the poll and antenna in the right of way there. And then just have the have the equipment the radio equipment on their property. That's that's one option, but that does not solve the neighborhood up. The neighborhood issue that we have to do and who does that. The other option is finding a spot of town land that's acceptable to put it at. And so some some of my thoughts are and and once again, this is their initial without visiting the site, but, you you know, we have a high spot over there on over Honda and Skyline. We own a piece of land there. That that's high. So that may or may not work. But III don't know how we have to think about what are the next steps. You know, what are our options right now knowing that Cal Water is isn't is not really favored in this huge structure on their land right now. So I'm open for input and discussion on on how to resolve this. Thank you.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [20:43](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1243)
Okay. Well, I think Ray and I and and probably Chris will will work with you to find the appropriate future. We like the the city right away. Very much.

Speaker 3  [21:00](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1260)
So we'll we'll get back to that. Okay, Ryan?

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [21:03](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1263)
Yeah. That's that's true. There's just some considerations. You know, when you put an antenna like this, you put a full antenna. It looks just like the one that's out here. It radiates in all directions. And I've been thinking about that place of an old Honda. So that's well north to the full route. So you're gonna be radiating way further north, that's not relevant to us, and possibly over the hill, which is growing. And this is 10 watts AM. So it it decays from a stream point very quickly. The reason why it is where it is is because it's in central control of alloys and it radiates beautifully all over. Told about hitting somewhere in Europe, some valleys, and around. So as I think about it, I'm sure it would work for some of what we're told about. Up at La Honda. But I wouldn't wanna be sitting at the end of Los Trancos. And expect people to hear it like they can hear it now. So we haven't tested that. That's just, you know, you gotta think about the the terrain and distance in our

Speaker 3  [22:10](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1330)
Let's fill that out.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [22:14](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1334)
We'll work with you, Alan.

Howard Young (Interim Town Manager)  [22:16](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1336)
Yeah. Thank you. And I know that, you know, we originally placed the antenna site here at town center, and there were probably some concerns. But Maybe in in in in this whole discussion, what to do with that site also, the existing post that's out there right now. So Thank you very much. And once again, you know you know, on behalf of the town, I apologize if there's any it was you know, obviously, there was some delay. Obviously, there's some some kind of communications between the town and, like, Cal Water that happened that basically they didn't ultimate the the the their top didn't ultimately know. What the final project is gonna be. So, hopefully, we can move forward and find a solution. Thank you.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [23:14](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1394)
I was just asking if the committee could reach out to the neighbors to get a sense of whether they'd be okay within AM and 10.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [23:24](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1404)
I'm sure they can, but it's not my job. Yeah. Yeah. Cecil's job. And it's not ASMs job for sure. Okay. The lead job is

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [23:33](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1413)
Well, that's why I'm that's Ray, that's why I'm asking mine.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [23:36](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1416)
Well, I'm not not Okay?

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [23:40](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1420)
So you're part of the emergency preparedness committee. And one of the things No. No. You just you asked me a question. Do you want an answer? Or you or you just wanna tell me so it's not your job, but I think it it could well be the committee's job. So it

Speaker 3  [23:53](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1433)
may not be your job. Yep. We'll do that.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [24:00](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1440)
Okay. Craig, AM radio science.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [24:09](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1449)
So the mayor and I talked about the signs, and and probably the the best thing is that Will, at some point, agendize it with the ASCC. Dale and I have talked about a couple of different possibilities mean, what I would recommend is that you guys come up with your, you know, three favorite. And then after we get through the housing elements and stuff, then we can agenda is it with ASCC and to be able to move that forward.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [24:38](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1478)
Thing. I think we have our three favorites already, but I will forward those on to you. Well, you know, this committee has all we can do with offers and suggestions there were 2 2 versions in the last packet. And since you have another one in the past, we we can forward all those on the 60. Ultimately, their decision, all we're doing recommending side. Very important.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [25:13](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1513)
I guess the question I was asking is whether the committee had had a discussion about the different times. Is Sure. The ASCC is gonna bring it to sort of a public hearing, so to speak. But I think having this committee discuss the issues. I mean, one of the issues that I don't fully understand. And, right, you might have been involved about FCC saying that this is CIS and it's not for emergency. And so, like, exactly what can we put on that sign and and, you know, are there issues with what we put on the sign? Relative to the FCC. So I think we need all that stuff resolved before it gets to the ASC. Otherwise, I think this is just gonna go around in the loop. And then I think it'd be interesting for this committee to weigh in on signs. I mean, particularly, this sign, you know, the signs that you and I have talked about have been sort of these blue signs. They're gonna be issues. People are gonna have issues with signage. I mean, there's always somebody in the town who's had issues with signage. So I think making sure you guys have sort of full discussion on it for a while rather than just work at the ASCC. My guess is it'll just go around in circles up there. So the more you guys can get lined up before it goes to ASC the better.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [26:25](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1585)
This committee has discussed this at the length I'm actually getting pretty tired. So just continue to put back in town. Great.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [26:32](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1592)
It's a deal, then you should just submit it. And and if it goes around in circles, then we will go around circles. But I've I've given you my advice, but I'm not here to tell you can you guys can do what you wanna do.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [26:44](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1604)
I'm I'm giving you my advice.

Speaker 3  [26:46](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1606)
That we've already done it. We voted three years ago.

Jerry Shefren (EPC)  [26:54](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1614)
My mind isn't quite five percent. I think it might be worthwhile to to just bring forward again. We have the goals.

Speaker 3  [27:05](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1625)
Refresh our minds. Yeah.

Marianne Plunder (EPC)  [27:07](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1627)
Yeah. A number of us weren't on the committee three years ago.

Speaker 3  [27:12](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1632)
Okay.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [27:16](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1636)
K. Next. But I have

Speaker 3  [27:18](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1638)
a question though. I'd go back. Yeah. We talked about the antenna. Wait. Do you have a the antenna at your place right now from here? I do.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [27:26](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1646)
Did you get the neighbor's approval? No.

Speaker 3  [27:30](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1650)
Okay. So but we do we have the

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [27:33](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1653)
The reason why I bring up the neighbors thing and the SSO tool because previous account manager, when Dale and I were

Speaker 3  [27:39](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1659)
they were marketing us out and getting the quote and doing the homework for it. That would have to pass it to you. It is on with a piece of property.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [27:48](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1668)
So my job was to get all

Speaker 3  [27:51](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1671)
the technical stuff together, get a look at the ground, and I did. What Howard got was over, and he could know that it like, he

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [28:00](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1680)
wasn't part of that company. That's why I think I'm happy to and by the way,

Speaker 3  [28:10](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1690)
this will be through as well.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [28:13](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1693)
That was quite a process.

Speaker 3  [28:15](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1695)
First. I never got it.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [28:21](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1701)
Okay. Onto the fire department and and we moved you guys up because we haven't heard from you in a couple of months. So I see both Selena and chief are on the line. Either one of you would like to go ahead and give us a quick update.

Rob Lindner (Fire Chief)  [28:38](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1718)
Sure. Good morning, everybody. Just an FYIn talk about in the in the first part when you guys are talking. And what I'm what I'm noticing, if you are not right on the mic, we and the public cannot hear you at all. Howard's Howard's microphone was fantastic. Craig's was Craig's was good, but the second you guys start to talk to each other we we can't hear anything on that side. So just FYI. But, anyway, let's say, yeah, it's been a couple of months. So weather event I gave it gave the weather events pretty much every meeting prior to this last one. So, fortunately, we haven't had the weather events to any extreme nature that we've had. We have this one going through right now, which hasn't posed you know, much of much of a problem at all other than it sounds like highway 35 now just got affected. It was closed this morning. Sounds like they have Unofficially, it sounds like they have, like, one lane open for the for residents to get through what they need to. But for traffic, it sounds like they've closed it. I don't have the the other details, we're trying to get that information right now, but add that one to the list, unfortunately. Let's see our station projects were back up and running full tilt until this latest rain came in, but they're progressing well. The bump back a a month or so. So they're still online to be completed before the end of the year, both the construction at station seven and the remodel at station eight. Gave you the update as much as I know on Skyline. I didn't hear initially, it sounded like It sounded like bud was asking about the maps. The maps are not completed yet. Once they're completed, they will vet through us we will advise our stakeholders, have some meetings before it goes to our board for approval, then it goes to the to the towns for approval after that. So it's still still not there yet, but there was some reworking that they were doing based on some comments that were made when it was presented to the board. To our board of directors a couple months ago. So no no specific timeline on that. The last thing I had probably heard through the grapevine a few months ago now. I submitted my retirement paperwork to our board of directors at the end of June. We've already gone through interviews, and my successor has been named. It happens to be on this meeting. So Current Deputy Fire Chief, Tom Cuschieri, has been named as my successor, the fire chief for the district. My last day in the office will be I think it's, like, June 20 second, and Tom will be taking over after that as the new fire chief. Then we we will be going through our next round of promotionals within the organization. So I was kinda giving you that at the captain and the Italian chief level, and it will continue as well. So that that's all I have.
