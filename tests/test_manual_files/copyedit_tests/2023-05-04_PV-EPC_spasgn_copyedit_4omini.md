Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [7:31](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=451)
Okay. Great. So we now have a quorum. It's 8 o'clock in the morning. We are going to go ahead and get started now that we solved all our technical issues. Thank you, Howard. Okay. The meeting is called to order. Let's do a quick roll call. And I see.

Various  [7:54](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=474)
Dave Howes. Marianne? Yeah. Chris. Ray Rothrock? Yeah. Jerry? Vic? Yes, here. Rob? Here.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [8:16](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=496)
And Randy, you're in the audience. Unfortunately, I can't count you as being here, except in the audience.

Rob Younge (EPC)  [8:25](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=505)
He's got COVID. Unfortunately.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [8:28](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=508)
Are you positive for COVID, Randy?

Randy True (EPC)  [8:31](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=511)
I am. Yes. My whole family has it and has been for a week. It's been a tough go. I've had no symptoms, but...

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [8:42](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=522)
Chris, I see you. Bud, you could make it. Thank you for participating. You're here. You just can't vote, but it's wonderful to see you. Okay. Oral communication. Do we have any oral communications from anybody out there that would like to speak? Bud.

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [9:02](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=542)
I have a question, but when it comes to the fire maps from the Fire Department, before 12 dollars, then will just come out.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [9:14](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=554)
When do the new ones come out? We will probably review them at least in September. We haven't reviewed in full committee yet. Do you have any idea when that might happen?

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [9:25](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=565)
No. As a part of this, you said anything.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [9:28](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=568)
They have released a preliminary fire map with what's called Firemapper, but it had a considerable number of problems with preliminary error maps, and so they are working through that. When are they going to get resolved? I don't know.

Bud Trapp (EPC)  [9:45](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=585)
Thank you.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [9:47](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=587)
Any other oral communication? Hey, I just have a couple of quick ones. I want to thank all of you who helped with the booth and communications trailer this past week in the Wildfire Preparedness Day, particularly a shout out to Ray, who got the trailer working, and to Sherry, who volunteered to drive it up and back on my days. That was a huge effort. So thank you, Jerry. We had great participation in the committee. Thank you all very much for that. The next thing is I want to shout out to our subcommittee system, which is working really well. A lot of progress and things coming up. In particular, on the eFax subcommittee, I think Rob Young, in particular, has made more progress in the last month on the executive plan than we probably have in 18 months. And I know Randy is getting involved there with schools in particular. So thank you. Hopefully, if you saw Rob's note, by June first, we're going to have something out for public comment or an evaluation plan. So that is huge. Okay. With that, we are going to proceed. If you all noticed, I'm sure you did, on the agenda, I moved the town report and fire department reports up because we missed those the last couple of meetings since they were later, and we had so many other things going on. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to the town report. Apparently, Corey was going to give us an update on the Internet, and I know Howard is here to talk about the AM radio. Then Craig will talk about the AM radio signs. So that was not working. Oh, I'm sorry. I skipped that over. We're going to go back right now.

Speaker X  [11:51](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=711)
Minutes. Again, thank you, Lynn so much.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [11:53](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=713)
We're in great minutes. Do I have all in favor? Great. Thank you. Really good. Thank you all so much. Okay. Now do we have the power people speak to us?

Howard Young (Interim Town Manager)  [12:33](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=753)
Okay. Thank you. And I know our communications. I wanted to add one thing: I wanted everyone to meet Justin Bixby on our maintenance crew here. Part of it is I wanted to just have an opportunity to show the faces of Public Works. Right now, it's just me and two maintenance folks. In an emergency, you're likely to see me, Justin, and likely Scott too. So I just wanted to introduce everyone to Justin Bixby. He's been with us for how long, Justin? Seven years. So he works on the buildings, trails, and your parks too. So thank you very much. So let's see. The first item here is concerning the Internet options for backup Internet. So Corey is not here, but she provided me some written comments to relay. Right now, our main Internet provider is Comcast, and Corey is looking into switching that to AT&T Fiber. And for the backup, they're looking into some type of satellite backup. Don't know if it's going to be Starlink or via SES, but they're exploring it. I think they're looking at cost and what the infrastructure is right now. So internally, between Corey and IT, they are deciding. Is that enough information?

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [14:10](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=850)
Yeah.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [14:16](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=856)
Rob Young, let me do 

Speaker 3  [14:18](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=858)
a good budget. So I take most of my time. 

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [14:23](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=863)
I took it out of the box 

Speaker 3  [14:25](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=865)
this week and plugged it in. It didn't work.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [14:29](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=869)
Didn't do anything. It hunted the satellites. Didn't do everything. And I had 93 megabits download.

Speaker 3  [14:37](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=877)
Five network sync.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [14:41](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=881)
So there are 3000 satellites up there now. There are 12,000 authorized, so there will be more dead spots in this guy. From a simplistic point of view and going online and reading about different services and organizations that are using, I would strongly recommend... I don't know what it will cost the town...

Speaker 3  [15:03](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=903)
but they'll report 700 bucks every 20 bucks...

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [15:07](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=907)
a month. That's what my fiber at my house was amazing. I was looking forward to reading the... And I will add...

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [15:30](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=930)
to that, I’ve had Starlink a little over a year now. I use it. I primarily got it as a backup to another Internet connection I have that goes out. Starlink never goes out. As long as you've got power, it's going to be there. Even AT&T Fiber goes out occasionally when they lose power.

Speaker 3  [15:48](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=948)
And, again, we...

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [15:53](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=953)
have a delay time, latency, much better with Starlink than any of the other satellite systems. Again, this committee strongly recommends to...

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [16:04](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=964)
start it. So...

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [16:07](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=967)
Okay. Let's go on, Howard.

Howard Young (Interim Town Manager)  [16:09](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=969)
Thank you for that input. Okay. Let's see. Next on the agenda is the update on the Cal Water site. So let me go back a little bit. A while ago, I was asked to basically install the antenna up at the Cal Water site. The concern with placing a facility there... I want to provide some context on how this occurred. I was told to get the antenna out there. I started getting quotes, and up on Peak and Cervantes, there’s a tank in that area that they own. The thought process was number one, I was asked to. There was a meeting I was not involved in, but there was a meeting and this was agreed to. So by the time I got involved, basically, I was just to get some quotes. So we were also to test the phone lines that existed on the property already from Cal Water. So that took some time to coordinate. Ray, thanks a lot for the drawings. Their drawings consisted of, I think, a hundred feet of trenching from the box to an open area, and then an antenna pole with an antenna and the grounding plane. As we were going through the contracts with Cal Water, they were asking for more and more information, detailed engineering drawings too. We slowly started submitting those things. Once it got to their engineering department, Don Smith then said, wait a second. This is not what we envisioned. For some reason, she envisioned it as an antenna mounted to the side of a tank to a handrail, and she didn't think there was a big deal. Now that she’s looked at it, she is concerned about neighbors because about 10 years ago, there was a proposal to put a cell site up there. There was a lot of publicity and concern from the neighbors, and the cell site got shut down. So she turned to me and said, did anyone check? We are concerned about the scope of work, but did anyone check with the neighbors? It turns out that no one has checked with the neighbors yet to install this facility there. So in speaking with Don, she has a huge concern that, you know, they're doing this to help the town and did not want any bad publicity out of it. What are we going to do to check with the neighbors? The concern about the scope came up too, so where do we go from here? That's probably the question. I'm trying to come up with some ideas, and we will probably have to work with Dale and Ray to come up with some ideas also. As to where this goes and how we're going to proceed. I had a couple ideas of, well, maybe we put the pole and antenna in the right-of-way there and then just have the radio equipment on their property. That's one option, but that does not solve the neighborhood issue that we have to address. The other option is finding a spot of town land that's acceptable to put it at. Some of my thoughts are, once again, this is initial without visiting the site, but we have high spots over there on Honda and Skyline. We own a piece of land there that’s high. So that may or may not work. We have to think about what our next steps are. What are our options right now knowing that Cal Water is not really favorable to having this huge structure on their land? I'm open for input and discussion on how to resolve this. Thank you.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [20:43](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1243)
Okay. I think Ray and I, and probably Chris, will work with you to find the appropriate future. We like the city right-of-way very much.

Speaker 3  [21:00](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1260)
So we'll get back to that. Okay, Ryan?

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [21:03](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1263)
Yeah. That's true. There are just some considerations. When you put an antenna like this, a full antenna, it looks just like the one that's out here. It radiates in all directions. I've been thinking about that place on Honda. That's well north of the full route. So you're going to be radiating way further north, that's not relevant to us, and possibly over the hill, which is growing. This is 10 watts AM, so it decays from a stream point very quickly. The reason it is where it is is because it's in central control of alloys, and it radiates beautifully all over. It’s told about hitting somewhere in Europe, some valleys, and around. As I think about it, I'm sure it would work for some of what we’d be told about up at La Honda. But I wouldn't want to be sitting at the end of Los Trancos and expect people to hear it like they can hear it now. So we haven't tested that. That's just something you have to think about—the terrain and distance we... 

Speaker 3  [22:10](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1330)
Let's flesh that out.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [22:14](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1334)
We'll work with you, Alan.

Howard Young (Interim Town Manager)  [22:16](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1336)
Yeah. Thank you. I know that we originally placed the antenna site here at Town Center, and there were probably some concerns. But maybe in this whole discussion, we should also look at what to do with that site as well as the existing post that's out there right now. Thank you very much. On behalf of the town, I apologize if there was any delay or miscommunication between the town and Cal Water. Hopefully, we can move forward and find a solution. Thank you.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [23:14](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1394)
I was just asking if the committee could reach out to the neighbors to get a sense of whether they'd be okay with an AM radio station.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [23:24](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1404)
I'm sure they can, but it's not my job. Yeah. Yeah. It's not the ASMC's job for sure. Okay. The lead job is...

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [23:33](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1413)
Well, that's why I'm asking, Ray. That's why I'm asking.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [23:36](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1416)
Well, I'm not...

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [23:40](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1420)
So you're part of the Emergency Preparedness Committee. And one of the things—

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [23:53](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1433)
may not be your job. Yep. We'll do that.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [24:00](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1440)
Okay, Craig. AM radio signs.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [24:09](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1449)
So the mayor and I talked about the signs, and probably the best thing is that we'll at some point agendize it with the ASCC. Dale and I have talked about a couple of different possibilities. I would recommend that you all come up with your three favorites, and then after we get through the housing elements and stuff, we can agendize it with ASCC to be able to move that forward.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [24:38](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1478)
Thing. I think we have our three favorites already, but I will forward those on to you. Well, you know, this committee has all we can do with offers and suggestions. There were two versions in the last packet. And since you have another one in the past, we can forward all those on to the sixty. Ultimately, their decision, all we're doing is recommending. Very important.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [25:13](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1513)
I guess the question I was asking is whether the committee had a discussion about the different signs. Sure, the ASCC is going to bring it to sort of a public hearing, so to speak. But I think having this committee discuss the issues, I mean, one of the issues that I don't fully understand. And, right, you might have been involved about the FCC saying that this is CIS and it's not for emergencies. And so, like, exactly what can we put on that sign? And, you know, are there issues with what we put on the sign relative to the FCC? So I think we need all that stuff resolved before it gets to the ASCC. Otherwise, I think this is just going to go around in a loop. And then I think it would be interesting for this committee to weigh in on signs. I mean, particularly this sign. You know, the signs that you and I have talked about have been sort of these blue signs. They're going to be issues. People are going to have issues with signage. I mean, there's always somebody in the town who's had issues with signage. So I think making sure you guys have sort of a full discussion on it for a while rather than just working at the ASCC, my guess is it'll just go around in circles up there. So the more you guys can get lined up before it goes to the ASCC, the better.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [26:25](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1585)
This committee has discussed this at length. I'm actually getting pretty tired, so just continue to put back in town. Great.

Craig Taylor (Council Liaison)  [26:32](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1592)
It's a deal, then you should just submit it. And if it goes around in circles, then we will go around in circles. But I've given you my advice, but I'm not here to tell you you guys can do what you want to do.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [26:44](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1604)
I'm giving you my advice.

Speaker 3  [26:46](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1606)
That we've already done it. We voted three years ago.

Jerry Shefren (EPC)  [26:54](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1614)
My mind isn't quite five percent. I think it might be worthwhile to just bring forward again. We have the goals.

Speaker 3  [27:05](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1625)
Refresh our minds. Yeah.

Marianne Plunder (EPC)  [27:07](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1627)
Yeah. A number of us weren't on the committee three years ago.

Speaker 3  [27:12](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1632)
Okay.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [27:16](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1636)
Okay. Next. But I have

Speaker 3  [27:18](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1638)
a question though. I'd go back. Yeah. We talked about the antenna. Wait. Do you have the antenna at your place right now from here? I do.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [27:26](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1646)
Did you get the neighbor's approval? No.

Speaker 3  [27:30](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1650)
Okay. So, but do we have the...

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [27:33](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1653)
The reason why I bring up the neighbors thing and the SSO tool because the previous account manager, when Dale and I were...

Speaker 3  [27:39](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1659)
they were marketing us out and getting the quote and doing the homework for it. That would have to pass it to you. It is on with a piece of property.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [27:48](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1668)
So my job was to get all...

Speaker 3  [27:51](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1671)
the technical stuff together, get a look at the ground, and I did. What Howard got was over, and he could know that it was like he...

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [28:00](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1680)
wasn't part of that company. That's why I think I'm happy to... and by the way,

Speaker 3  [28:10](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1690)
this will be through as well.

Ray Rothrock (EPC)  [28:13](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1693)
That was quite a process.

Speaker 3  [28:15](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1695)
First. I never got it.

Dale Pfau (EPC Chair)  [28:21](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1701)
Okay. Onto the Fire Department, and we moved you guys up because we haven't heard from you in a couple of months. So I see both Selena and Chief are on the line. Either one of you would like to go ahead and give us a quick update.

Rob Lindner (Fire Chief)  [28:38](https://youtu.be/hNFjjFll1EY&t=1718)
Sure. Good morning, everybody. Just an FYI to talk about in the first part when you guys are talking, and what I'm noticing is if you are not right on the mic, we and the public cannot hear you at all. Howard's microphone was fantastic. Craig's was good, but the second you guys start to talk to each other, we can't hear anything on that side. So just FYI. But anyway, let's see, yeah, it's been a couple of months. Regarding the weather event, I gave the weather events pretty much every meeting prior to this last one. So, fortunately, we haven't had the weather events to any extreme nature that we've had. We have this one going through right now, which hasn't posed much of a problem at all other than it sounds like Highway 35 now just got affected. It was closed this morning. Sounds like they have unofficially, it sounds like they have one lane open for the residents to get through what they need to. But for traffic, it sounds like they've closed it. I don't have the other details; we're trying to get that information right now, but add that one to the list, unfortunately. Let's see, our station projects were back up and running full tilt until this latest rain came in, but they're progressing well. They bumped back a month or so, so they're still online to be completed before the end of the year, both the construction at Station Seven and the remodel at Station Eight. I gave you the update as much as I know on Skyline. I didn't hear initially; it sounded like Bud was asking about the maps. The maps are not completed yet. Once they're completed, they will vet through us; we will advise our stakeholders, have some meetings before it goes to our board for approval, then it goes to the towns for approval after that. So, it's still not there yet, but there was some reworking that they were doing based on some comments that were made when it was presented to our board of directors a couple of months ago. So, no specific timeline on that. The last thing I had, probably heard through the grapevine a few months ago now, I submitted my retirement paperwork to our board of directors at the end of June. We've already gone through interviews, and my successor has been named. It happens to be on this meeting. So Current Deputy Fire Chief Tom Cuschieri has been named as my successor, the Fire Chief for the district. My last day in the office will be, I think it's, like, June 22nd, and Tom will be taking over after that as the new Fire Chief. Then we will be going through our next round of promotionals within the organization. So, I was kind of giving you that at the captain and the Italian Chief level, and it will continue as well. So, that's all I have.
