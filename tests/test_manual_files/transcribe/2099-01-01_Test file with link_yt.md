The famous physicist Richard P. Feynman always loved to test complex systems in the spirit of curiosity and fun and nowhere was this more true than in the security systems of the most complex scientific project in history, the Manhattan Project, where the greatest scientists of the age were gathered to create the first atomic bomb and in the process develop much of the scientific underpinnings of our modern civilization. 

Feynman, being Feynman, found that the best way to challenge the rigor of the establishment was with good old-fashioned mischief. He earned fame (or infamy) inside the safes of Los Alamos, cracking them with ease and leaving cryptic messages pretending to be a spy (all while real Soviet spies were inside and really learning the new nuclear secrets!) - hence his seemingly bizarre mischief making was indeed prophetic in many ways. 

Here, Richard Feynman talks briefly about how he tested fence security simply by "taking the path of least action" - through the holes in the fence! Funny stuff straight from the legendary man's mouth! Enjoy!

there was a little annoyances from censorship and so forth but and checking in at gates and all kinds of things but there was it was understandable that such a thing had to go in fact most of the complaints was of a security was rather lacks in places there would be big holes in the outside fence the demand could walk through standing up and I used to enjoy going out through the gate coming in through the fence hole and going out through the gate again and then through the fence hole until the poor sergeant at the gate would gradually realize that this guy's come out of place four times without going in once and he kind of arrests me sort of
