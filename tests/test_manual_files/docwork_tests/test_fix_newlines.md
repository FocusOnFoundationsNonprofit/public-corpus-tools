Coordinator: 
Hello and thank you for standing by.  At this time I’d like to inform all 
participants that today’s call is being recorded.  If you have any objections 
you may disconnect at this time.  You have been placed in listen-only mode 
until the question-and-answer session of today’s call.  At that time we are 
taking calls over the phone only.  And if you would like to ask a question 
please press Star 1 and please make sure that your phone is unmuted and 
record your name clearly when prompted so I may announce you for your 
question. Thank you and you may begin with your host Ms. Irene Aihie. 
Irene Aihie: 
Hello and welcome to today’s FDA webinar.  I am Irene Aihie of CDRH’s 
Office of Communication and Education.  On February 29, the FDA issued 
the immediately in effect guidance titled Policy for Diagnostics Testing in 
Laboratories Certified to Perform High Complexity Testing Under CLIA prior 
to Emergency Use Authorization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 during the 
Public Health Emergency.   
This guidance provides a policy for novel coronavirus molecular diagnostic 
tests developed and used in laboratories certified to perform high complexity

testing under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments prior to 
issuance of emergency use authorizations for such tests.   
Today Timothy Stenzel, Director in the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic and 
Radiologic Health in the Office of Product Evaluation and Quality here in 
CDRH will present an overview of the guidance document. Following the 
presentation we will open the line for your questions related to information 
provided during the presentation.   
Additionally there are other center subject matter experts here with us today to 
assist with the Q&A portion of our webinar.  Now I give you Timothy.   
Timothy Stenzel: Welcome.  It’s great to share this new policy with you today.  This policy is 
for diagnostic testing, in laboratories certified to perform high complexity 
testing under CLIA, prior to EUA authorization.  The agenda today will be to 
go through the background summary of the immediately in effect guidance 
and then of course take questions and provide some answers.   
The objective today is to explain this new policy for molecular diagnostic 
testing and high complexity Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments 
(CLIA) certified labs prior to emergency use authorization for coronavirus 
disease 2019 and now the coronavirus during this public health emergency. 
Some background.  This guidance was issued on February 29, 2020.  It 
describes a policy regarding certain laboratories immediately using tests they 
have developed and validated in order to achieve a more rapid testing capacity 
in the United States.   
With the COVID-19 public health emergency the FDA has determined that 
prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate.  And

issued this guidance without prior public comment.  This guidance document 
is immediately in effect but remains subject to comment in accordance with 
the FDAs good guidance practices.   
Scope.  This policy is limited to laboratories certified to perform high 
complexity testing consistent with the requirements under the clinical 
laboratory improvement amendment and is for molecular diagnostics for the 
SARS-COV-2 virus.  The new policy does not impact requirements under 
CLIA, does not impact CDC recommendations for who should be tested.   
Policy.  The guidance includes recommendations regarding validating newly 
developed coronavirus tests prior to clinical use, notifying the FDA when 
clinical use of a validated test begins, confirming the first five positive and 
negative samples with EUA authorized tests, indicating in test reports that the 
test has been validated but independent review by the FDA is not complete, 
submitting EUA within 15 days of initiating testing and, finally, steps to take 
if any specimen fails confirmatory testing or if the FDA is unable to authorize 
the EUA.   
Test validation.  The guidance includes recommendations regarding the 
minimal testing to be performed for validation.  These include Limit of 
Detection or LOD, clinical evaluation, inclusivity, cross reactivity. And then 
comments on the limited viral materials that are available to the FDA, 
BARDA, and the CDC of prioritized and coordinated shipments to labs when 
ready to validate.   
You can address this by sending an email to the FDA email as listed later in 
this presentation.  This is limit of detection testing under this guidance defined 
as the lowest concentration in which at least 19 of 20 replicates are positive.  
The methods include we recommend testing dilution series with three
