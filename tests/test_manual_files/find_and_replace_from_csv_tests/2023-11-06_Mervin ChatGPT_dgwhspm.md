This is amazing. How to integrate chat GPT API into your Python application. That's exactly what we're going to see today. Let's get started. Hi, everyone. I'm really excited to show you about chat GPT API integration in Python. First, Conda create hyphen and chat GPT Python 3.11 to create the virtual environment. Then Conda activate chat GPT. Next pip install openai and click enter. That is the openai package for chat GPT. Now create a file called app.py and open the file. Now import open AI. Now client equals open AI dot open AI within the brackets. Next response equals client dot chat completions dot create. Inside the brackets you're entering the model name I'm going to use GPT 3.5 turbo inside messages I'm providing the role as user and the content who won the cricket World Cup in 2019 That is the question I'm asking chat GPT. Now you can print the response dot choices message dot content. That's it. As a quick overview first import open AI then create the client open a dot open a then client dot chat completions dot create and set the model name GPT 3.5 turbo then provide the messages as Role as user and the content which is the question we are asking to chat GPT next print the result Now we are going to run this code Now export open AI API key like this and click enter. Go to your terminal pythonapp.py and click enter. The England cricket team won the cricket world cup in 2019. That's it. As simple as that. Now you can integrate this code in any of your application. I'll be creating more chat GPT API videos so stay tuned. I am also creating regular AI videos in my channel so please have a look. I hope you like this video.
