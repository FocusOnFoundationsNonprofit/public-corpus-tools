So you want to represent the integers, 1, 2, 3, and you can use physical objects like fingers to say that will be 1, that's called 2, that's called 3, and so on. And __computers are ways of instantiating abstract objects and their relationships in physical objects and their motion.__ So now what happens with quantum computers is that we simply take the deepest physical theory we have, quantum theory, and we say \"What kind of information processing does quantum theory in general allow and what does it not allow?\" And that's the theory of quantum computation.\nQUOTED ANSWER STARS: 5\nQUOTED QUESTION SIMILARITY SCORE: 100%\n\n",
        "ai_answer": "At a deep level, computers and computation can be understood through the lens of how physical objects are used to represent and manipulate abstract objects. According to David Deutsch, computation within any physical law involves using physical entities to represent abstract concepts like numbers or logical statements. For example, using fingers to represent integers such as 1, 2, and 3 is a basic form of computation.\n\nIn the context of computers, these abstract objects and their relationships are instantiated within physical objects (like transistors in classical computers) and their motions or state changes. Essentially, a computer leverages the properties and behaviors of physical materials to perform operations based on abstract computational rules.\n\nWhen it comes to quantum computers, the process digs deeper into the fabric of reality by utilizing quantum theory, the most profound physical theory we have. Quantum computers explore what kinds of information processing are permitted and restricted by quantum mechanics. Hence, at its core, computation, whether classical or quantum, is the manifestation of abstract operations within the framework of physical laws and materials.",
