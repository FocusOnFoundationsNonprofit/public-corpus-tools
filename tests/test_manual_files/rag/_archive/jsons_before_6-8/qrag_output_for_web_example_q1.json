                    "answer": "_Regarding the significance of our existence,_ this has to do with both moral and aesthetic values. What we're trying to do, even though many people try to deny this, they deny that they are seeking, trying to do what is right or trying to create what is actually beautiful and so on. But that is what we're trying to do, and that is the meaning. Religions traditionally thought that the meaning was already known or had been revealed to humans and that what our task is, is to live up to that, to enact it. My view is the other way around, that __the meaning of life is something that we are using creativity to discover, to build. There isn't a perfectly accurate word for what we're doing, but we can't find the meaning of life in the world out there, nor just by pure thought or by reference to an authority. What we have to do is form explanations about what is right and wrong, what is better and worse, what's beautiful and ugly, and hone those theories while also trying to meet them. At any one moment, we will meet them imperfectly, just like scientific theories at any one moment are only an imperfect explanation of what the physical world is like. But through criticism and conjecture and seeking the truth, we can eliminate the errors in what we had previously thought and thereby make progress. And that is trying to find the meaning of life, trying to create the meaning of life is the meaning of life.__ *IN-LINE: So we want to model and articulate reality.* Yes, both moral, aesthetic, as well as abstract and physical reality.

        "ai_answer": "David Deutsch's philosophy suggests that the meaning of life is not something pre-determined or revealed to us, but something that we actively create and discover through our own efforts. According to Deutsch, this process involves using our creativity to form and refine explanations about what is right and wrong, beautiful and ugly, and better or worse. \n\nIn his view, the meaning of life is intrinsically tied to moral and aesthetic values, and our task is to develop and hone theories about these values through a process of conjecture and criticism. Just as scientific theories evolve by eliminating errors and incorporating better explanations, so too do our understandings of moral and aesthetic values.\n\nUltimately, for Deutsch, the meaning of life lies in the continuous quest to seek and create meaning, using our creativity to make progress in our understanding of both the world and our place within it. This endeavor is seen as a never-ending journey rather than a final destination, reflecting a deep optimism about the potential for ongoing improvement and discovery."
