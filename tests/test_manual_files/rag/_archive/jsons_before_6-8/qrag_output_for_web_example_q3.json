        "ai_answer": "At a deep level, computers and computation involve using physical objects to represent and manipulate abstract objects and their relationships. For example, you can represent numbers like 1, 2, and 3 using your fingers. Similarly, traditional computers use various physical components to instantiate abstract concepts and their interrelationships through physical motions and states.\n\nIn the context of quantum computation, we take quantum theory\u2014our most fundamental physical theory\u2014and explore the kinds of information processing it permits. This involves determining what quantum theory allows in terms of representing and manipulating information and what it prohibits. Thus, quantum computers are an advanced form of computation that utilizes the principles of quantum theory to perform information processing in ways that classical computers cannot."
