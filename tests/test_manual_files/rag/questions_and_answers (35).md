QUOTED ANSWER 1: _Regarding what makes life worthwhile,_ you think I'm going to say "having fun," but having fun is not a specific thing. So it's different for everybody. Everybody has their own problem situation. Everybody has their own impediments to solving things and to having fun. And everybody has hangups and ways in which their thinking is imperfect. And so, I think the meaning of life is to remove those impediments and go towards the things that solve your problems and to seek richer problems and so on. I say all these things, but I couldn't put it better than the way Popper put it. I think he says the way to do science and philosophy, but I would extend this as the way just to live life in general, is to find a problem, fall in love with it. And then, well, you can look up what he says. He says it very beautifully. And then if you should happen to solve it. Now, I like the way he says, "If you should solve it," he kind of assumes that normally you won't solve it. And that's great. And almost solving it might be regarded as a bit of a disaster. But he says, __"No, it's not a disaster because if you happen to solve it, it will have lots of delightful problem children, enchanting problem children."__ I think he says. So I think I've got to go with his answer.

### QUOTED QUESTION 2: What is meaning of life, the significance of our existence?

QUOTED ANSWER 2: _Regarding the significance of our existence,_ this has to do with both moral and aesthetic values. What we're trying to do, even though many people try to deny this, they deny that they are seeking, trying to do what is right or trying to create what is actually beautiful and so on. But that is what we're trying to do, and that is the meaning. Religions traditionally thought that the meaning was already known or had been revealed to humans and that what our task is, is to live up to that, to enact it. My view is the other way around, that __the meaning of life is something that we are using creativity to discover, to build. There isn't a perfectly accurate word for what we're doing, but we can't find the meaning of life in the world out there, nor just by pure thought or by reference to an authority. What we have to do is form explanations about what is right and wrong, what is better and worse, what's beautiful and ugly, and hone those theories while also trying to meet them. At any one moment, we will meet them imperfectly, just like scientific theories at any one moment are only an imperfect explanation of what the physical world is like. But through criticism and conjecture and seeking the truth, we can eliminate the errors in what we had previously thought and thereby make progress. And that is trying to find the meaning of life, trying to create the meaning of life is the meaning of life.__ *IN-LINE: So we want to model and articulate reality.* Yes, both moral, aesthetic, as well as abstract and physical reality. Yes, exactly.

### AI ANSWER:
The meaning of life, according to David Deutsch, can be understood through the lens of creativity and problem-solving. Deutsch draws from the philosophical ideas of Karl Popper, suggesting that lifeâ€™s significance lies in our pursuit of understanding, progress, and improvement.

In essence, he believes that meaning isn't something externally predefined for us to discover but is instead something we create. This creative process involves generating new explanations, discovering moral, aesthetic, and scientific truths, and continually refining our understanding through conjecture, criticism, and constant progress.

Deutsch emphasizes the idea of falling in love with problems and immersing ourselves in the quest to solve them. Even when we solve a problem, new "delightful" and "enchanting problem children" emerge, providing ongoing opportunities for growth and discovery. Thus, the journey of seeking solutions and confronting new, richer problems is a significant part of what makes life meaningful.

To summarize, the meaning of life, according to David Deutsch, is an ongoing process of using our creativity to build and discover new understandings, solve problems, and strive towards moral and aesthetic ideals through persistent scientific and philosophical inquiry.
