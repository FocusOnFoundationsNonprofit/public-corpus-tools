QUOTED ANSWER 1: Rather than ask about the word _'spirit'_, I would prefer to concentrate on the phenomenon. I think this progress that I referred to at the beginning, which was caused by the pursuit of truth and good explanations and so on, has been accompanied from the outset by various forms of rebellion against it. So that some of them are very overt, and __I think the spiritual trend that you're referring to, if I understand correctly what you're referring to, is one of the rebellion, the sort of rebellion against reason.__ It is saying that there is something more to the world than true and false. That perhaps if we feel that something is true, that can make it true. Perhaps if we want something to be true, that can make it true. Or hope it to be true. Or hope that it's true. Of course, there is a grain of truth in that, as I said earlier, only the laws of physics stand between us and knowledge stand between us and achieving what we want. But that's not what we mean here. The spiritual angle that I was criticizing is that we can make things be true just by believing them to be true, or hoping or wishing, as you said. Now that rebellion, I think, is wholly false. It's a sort of hangover from pre-rational times, but it also has an entirely modern aspect, which is that it is a rebellion. The ancient spiritualism and religiousness and so on was not a rebellion against reason. Reason, as we know it, hadn't really been invented. But the modern one is. And just for completeness, let me say that I think __a more dangerous enemy to reason is not this overt rejection of it in spiritualism, but the apparent acceptance or even worship of it.__ The best way I can describe this is that the French Revolution described itself as the triumph of reason. And the result was mass slaughter, including the killing of the most prominent scientists in France, and the imposition of bloodthirsty dictatorship, followed by Napoleon and war and so on. And all this was done by people who believed that they were overthrowing ancient unreason in favor of reason. And they called this the Enlightenment. And to me, this is just another rebellion. This is the Enlightenment rebellion against reason. But the Enlightenment also had another strand, which was initially followed more in the English-speaking countries, which was in favor not of establishing immediately a state called "reason," which would be the ideal state and which would then not need any further improvement, but on the contrary, to try to improve things so that institutions were able to correct their own errors. So this was a very gradualist and evolutionary approach to unlimited progress. One of the paradoxes of the bad kind of application of reason is that even if you were to succeed in doing that, it would mean that you had, and achieving your utopia, it would mean that no further progress was possible. And if no further progress is possible, then what we were saying earlier is the essence of humanity would no longer be possible either. Humans would just be functionaries in this idealized utopia, and there'd be no point in being one. And well, so but in practice, it just led to violence, whereas the good side of the Enlightenment is the thing that is now the basis of Western civilization, and has the potential for unlimited further progress in the future, if we make the right choices. If we make the wrong choices, we could just destroy it and go back to stasis or worse, just as happened with every previous attempt at progress in human history.

QUOTED ANSWER 2: _Regarding efforts to fight the influence of postmodernism,_ I think it's very important. At the moment, the postmodern attack on civilization is probably the most dangerous of the intellectual attacks. I can't quantify how much danger there is of nuclear war at the moment. Obviously, that would be worse if it happened. But apart from physical danger, I think in the long run, the intellectual danger is probably worse because if there's nothing to defend, then it doesn't matter if we give in to nuclear blackmail or whatever.

### AI ANSWER:
David Deutsch's understanding of why someone might develop a postmodernist worldview can likely be inferred from his broader philosophical stance on reason, progress, and the rejection thereof.

From QUOTED ANSWER 1, Deutsch highlights a "rebellion against reason" as being part of broader trends, including modern spiritualism. Postmodernism, similarly, can be seen as another form of rebellion against the established frameworks of reason, objectivity, and truth. This rejection could stem from:

1. **Disillusionment with Modernity**: Postmodernist thought often emerges from a perceived failure of modernist ideals, such as progress and enlightenment, to deliver universal benefits. Instances of war, inequality, and various societal issues might lead individuals to doubt the dominant narratives offered by modernist rationality.

2. **Critique of Meta-Narratives**: Postmodernism fundamentally questions grand narratives or universal truths that modernity seeks to establish. Individuals adopting a postmodernist view might feel that existing meta-narratives are exclusionary or fail to capture the multiplicity of human experiences.

3. **Suspicion of Objective Truth**: As QUOTED ANSWER 1 suggests, some forms of rebellion involve the belief that subjective experiences or beliefs could shape reality. Postmodernism often emphasizes the subjective construction of reality, rejecting the notion that objective truths can be universally known.

From QUOTED ANSWER 2, Deutsch points out the intellectual danger of postmodernist thinking:

4. **Mistrust in Institutions**: Periods of crises or perceived institutional failures can lead people to a postmodernist skepticism of institutions that claim to embody rationality or progress. This mistrust can foster a worldview where all such claims are seen as suspect or manipulative.

5. **Desire for Pluralism**: Postmodernism frequently advocates for pluralism, valuing diverse perspectives and rejecting the imposition of a single worldview. Individuals may be drawn to postmodernism as it promotes inclusivity of differing voices and experiences.

In summary, someone might develop a postmodernist worldview due to disillusionment with modernist promises, a critique of overarching meta-narratives, skepticism toward objective truths, mistrust of institutions, and a desire for inclusivity and pluralism. This worldview can be seen as part of a broader intellectual rebellion against what is perceived as the overreach or failures of rationalist modernity.

### QUOTED QUESTION 1: What is bad philosophy?

QUOTED TIMESTAMP 1: [5:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eEffbjzNwE&t=348)
QUOTED ANSWER 1: __Bad philosophy is a subset of bad explanations.__ False philosophy is not harmful. In fact, error is the standard state of human knowledge. We can expect to find error everywhere, including in the theories that we think are, that we most cherish as true. But there has grown up, especially since the Enlightenment, ironically, since good explanations have begun to take over, bad explanations have become worse and bad philosophy has dominated the field of philosophy for many decades. Bad philosophy is philosophy whose effect is to close off the growth of knowledge in that field. So it's the kind of thing that says not just so-and-so is true when in fact it is false, but you mustn't think about so-and-so, or it's bad to investigate so-and-so. Logical positivism is a prime example of a bad philosophy.  *IN-LINE: Which restricts your ability to even address questions as meaningless because it's not either sense data or logic or something like that.* Exactly right. So it's saying that trying to understand what the physics is of unobserved objects is unscientific, according to positivism. Now that means really that it's trying to reduce us to an anthropocentric worldview, rather like the medieval worldview, because it's saying that the only things that are worthy of study are human experiences. But of course human experiences are themselves to be understood in terms of unexperienced things like neurons. So the whole philosophy collapses, and in addition it declares itself to be meaningless because this distinction that it draws applies to itself as well and rules out positivism as a worthy subject of study.  *IN-LINE: What are other examples of bad philosophy?* The ones that are closest to my mind are the ones that have impinged on physics. So logical positivism was one example of that. But __when, in recent times, statistical analysis of experimental results has started to use terminology that assumes that certain things will never be worth studying. So for example, the very term explanation has come to mean a mathematical formula. They say a mathematical formula explains the results. But since the results are anthropocentric and they are not reality, they're just a tiny sliver of reality through which we are trying to understand the unobserved reality, this idea that a formula is an explanation prevents real explanations from being discovered. They are ruled illegitimate.__

### AI ANSWER:
Postmodernism is a broad intellectual movement that emerged in the mid-20th century as a reaction against the ideas and values of modernism, particularly its confidence in progress, science, and objective truth. Postmodernism is characterized by a skeptical attitude towards grand narratives and ideologies, questioning the notions of fixed meanings, identities, and objective realities. It often emphasizes the relative and subjective nature of knowledge, suggesting that what we consider to be "truth" is influenced by social, cultural, and historical contexts.

Key aspects of postmodernism include:

1. **Relativism:** Postmodernism argues that perspectives and interpretations are relative and contingent upon various factors, rejecting the idea of a single, universal truth.
2. **Deconstruction:** It involves analyzing and deconstructing texts and ideas to reveal hidden biases, contradictions, and assumptions.
3. **Fragmentation:** Postmodern thought often highlights the fragmented and decentralized nature of reality, rejecting unified, coherent explanations.
4. **Pastiche and Parody:** In art and literature, postmodernism often employs pastiche, parody, and playfulness, mixing different styles and genres to challenge traditional boundaries.
5. **Skepticism of Meta-Narratives:** Postmodernism is skeptical of overarching stories or "meta-narratives" that claim to explain historical or social phenomena comprehensively, such as Marxism or the Enlightenment rationalism.

David Deutsch views postmodernism as particularly dangerous because it attacks fundamental concepts like objective truth and progress, which are vital for the growth of knowledge and the advancement of civilization. He argues that postmodernism's intellectual influence can undermine efforts to solve problems and defend against more immediate, physical dangers, such as nuclear threats.
