#### user question: What is the meaning of life?
##### deutsch_qrag_v1
bot answer: The quest for the meaning of life is an endeavor that transcends mere existence, urging us to engage deeply with the fabric of reality, morality, and aesthetics. It is not a static truth waiting to be uncovered through sensory experience or authoritative decree but a dynamic, creative process of discovery and construction. The meaning of life emerges from our continuous effort to form, criticize, and refine our explanations of what is right and wrong, beautiful and ugly, and to align our actions with these evolving understandings.

This process mirrors the growth of knowledge in the realm of science, where theories are perpetually subject to conjecture and criticism, aiming to eliminate errors and inch closer to the truth. Just as scientific theories at any given moment offer an imperfect explanation of the physical world, our moral and aesthetic theories are similarly provisional, always open to improvement and deeper insight.

In this light, the meaning of life is fundamentally about the pursuit of good explanations—those that are hard to vary yet encompass what they seek to explain, whether in the domain of ethics, aesthetics, or the natural world. It is through this pursuit that we not only seek to understand the universe and our place within it but also strive to enhance the quality of our existence and the world around us.


Thus, the meaning of life is not a predetermined endpoint but a journey of creation and discovery, propelled by our unceasing quest for better explanations and a deeper understanding of the complex tapestry of reality. It is a journey marked by the belief that through the application of reason, creativity, and critical thinking, we can progressively make sense of our existence and, in doing so, forge a path toward a more meaningful and fulfilling life.

source_question: What is meaning of life, the significance of our existence?
source_answer: _Regarding the significance of our existence,_ this has to do with both moral and aesthetic values. What we're trying to do, even though many people try to deny this, they deny that they are seeking, trying to do what is right or trying to create what is actually beautiful and so on. But that is what we're trying to do, and that is the meaning. Religions traditionally thought that the meaning was already known or had been revealed to humans and that what our task is, is to live up to that, to enact it. My view is the other way around, that __the meaning of life is something that we are using creativity to discover, to build. There isn't a perfectly accurate word for what we're doing, but we can't find the meaning of life in the world out there, nor just by pure thought or by reference to an authority. What we have to do is form explanations about what is right and wrong, what is better and worse, what's beautiful and ugly, and hone those theories while also trying to meet them. At any one moment, we will meet them imperfectly, just like scientific theories at any one moment are only an imperfect explanation of what the physical world is like. But through criticism and conjecture and seeking the truth, we can eliminate the errors in what we had previously thought and thereby make progress. And that is trying to find the meaning of life, trying to create the meaning of life is the meaning of life.__ *IN-LINE: So we want to model and articulate reality.* Yes, both moral, aesthetic, as well as abstract and physical reality. Yes, exactly.

source_question: What does it mean to know everything?
source_answer: When I was a child, I remember being told that in the distant past, a very learned person might hope to understand everything that was understood. Whereas now because of specialization, because so much is known, that's impossible. That one person can only understand a very small fraction of what's known. And I really didn't believe this, I didn't want to believe this. And I envied the ancient scholars who might have aspired to knowing everything that was known at the time. And what I meant by, "knowing everything that was known," or "understanding everything that was understood," is not that they knew in detail everything that happened, that they had lists of things which they remembered. That's very far from what I meant. I meant that they understood all the explanations that were known. And I believe that we are not heading away from an era in which one might understand all the explanations as they're known, but towards it, because we are continually unifying and broadening and deepening our explanations of the world.

source_question: What is the meaning of reality in the context of quantum mechanics?
source_answer: _Regarding the meaning of reality in the context of quantum mechanics, some physicists_ put it in terms of "How do we make sense of the unitary evolution compared with what we see at a measurement?" and so on. I would want to start before that. I think we want to understand the world. We want to understand how the world is. And that is not necessarily what we perceive. Our perceptions are at the end of a long chain of physical processes of which themselves we only have scientific knowledge or indirect knowledge. So I would start with the question, "How do we explain quantum phenomena like interference?" Not how do we make sense of quantum theory, which gives the right prediction, but first before that, how do we explain quantum phenomena? So there's an interference process and we have interference pattern which we can see without any quantum mechanics that the result of the experiment cannot be explained by the events that we see. Now, this is not very unusual. This happens a lot in physics and ultimately every observation is made very indirectly. So we have to infer things that are not there. Although infer is the wrong word. We have to conjecture explanations. So that's where I would start.

source_question: What is the ideal lifespan for humans if life extension becomes possible?
source_answer: Well, life extension will be a part of it inevitably, as will arbitrary longevity. __I think it's rather insane to want a finite lifespan. I think it's the same kind of thing as death cults that have sometimes arisen where people kill themselves voluntarily because they believe that's their purpose.__ I think that what's forgotten when people say that they would, for example, get bored with a long life, if a human being doesn't improve for 900 years, yes, they're going to be pretty bored. In the long run, think of it as evolution in action. Those who kill themselves will kill themselves and those who don't will survive. So in the long run, my view, namely that an arbitrarily long life is a good thing, will inevitably triumph. That is whether it is true or not, but it is true. *IN-LINE: So you'd go for the 900 years yourself? Plus?* Yes. Certainly, plus.

bot answer: The meaning of life, from the perspective of the worldview and philosophy outlined, is not a singular, predefined answer waiting to be discovered. Instead, it is deeply intertwined with the creation and growth of knowledge, the solving of problems, and the pursuit of good explanations about the universe and our place within it. Life's meaning is found in the continuous process of conjecture and criticism, where individuals engage in the creation of new ideas, the correction of errors, and the improvement of our understanding of reality.

This process is not just a means to practical ends but is an end in itself, reflecting the unique capacity of people to generate explanatory knowledge. This capacity enables us to transcend our immediate sensory experiences and to grasp the underlying truths of the universe, thereby giving us the power to shape our environment and destiny in profound ways.

Moreover, the pursuit of good explanations and the solving of problems are inherently optimistic activities. They are based on the principle that problems are solvable given the right knowledge and that the growth of knowledge is the most effective way to address the challenges we face. This optimism is not blind but is grounded in the understanding that while our knowledge is fallible and always subject to improvement, it is also the most powerful tool we have for making progress and finding meaning.

In this light, the meaning of life can be seen as the journey of discovery and creation, where each individual's quest for understanding and improvement contributes to the collective knowledge of humanity. This journey is not just about the accumulation of facts but about deepening our comprehension of the universe, enhancing our ability to solve problems, and enriching the quality of our existence.

Thus, the meaning of life, in this worldview, is fundamentally linked to the growth of knowledge, the exercise of creativity, and the capacity to envision and bring about a better future. It is a testament to the significance of human minds in the cosmos and the boundless potential of explanatory knowledge to transform the world.

On several occasions it chose which of the two largest parties would govern, twice changing sides and three times choosing to put the less popular of the two (as measured by votes) into power. The FDP's leader was usually made a cabinet minister as part of the coalition deal, with the result that for the last twenty-nine years of that period Germany had only two weeks without an FDP foreign minister. In I998, when the FDP was pushed into fourth place by the Green Party, it was immediately ousted from government, and the Greens assumed the mantle of kingmakers.

#### user question: what is a good explanation?
##### deutsch_qrag_v1
bot answer: A good explanation is a profound and insightful statement about the nature of reality, detailing not only how things are but also why they behave in certain ways. It transcends mere observation or prediction by providing a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms and principles that govern phenomena. Such explanations are characterized by their hard-to-vary nature, meaning they cannot be easily modified without losing their explanatory power. This quality distinguishes good explanations from bad ones, which are often overly flexible, allowing them to account for any observation and thus failing to provide genuine insight.

Good explanations are the cornerstone of scientific inquiry and intellectual progress. They enable us to make sense of complex systems, predict future occurrences under similar conditions, and, most importantly, solve problems by identifying and addressing their root causes. In the realm of science, a good explanation must also be falsifiable, offering clear predictions that can be tested and potentially refuted by empirical evidence. This criterion ensures that explanations are grounded in the physical reality and subject to continuous refinement and improvement.

Moreover, good explanations have a certain elegance and simplicity, capturing the essence of what they aim to explain without unnecessary complexity. They often reveal unexpected connections between seemingly disparate phenomena, demonstrating the reach and universality of fundamental principles. Through the lens of good explanations, the world becomes a place of infinite wonder and possibility, where knowledge grows through the iterative process of conjecture and criticism, and human creativity knows no bounds.

In essence, a good explanation is a beacon of clarity in the vast sea of uncertainty, guiding us toward a deeper understanding of the universe and our place within it. It embodies the optimistic view that problems are solvable, provided we can find the right explanations to illuminate the path forward.

source_question: What is a good explanation?
source_answer: _The quest for good explanations_ is the basis of the book _The Beginning of Infinity_ and that's why I wrote the book. It's about good explanations basically and the many ramifications of that concept. This idea has been contradicted in many different ways, not just the ones you just mentioned. So an explanation is a statement about how the world is and how it behaves and why. And the why part always involves explaining what we see in terms of what we don't see. Explaining what we know is there in terms of what we guess is there and sometimes that changes our mind about what we know is there. So that's an explanation but most explanations are bad. And in the book I argue that good explanation is one that is hard to vary. While still explaining what it purports to explain and therefore the epitome of a bad explanation is one that could explain anything. If you say for example, you know, conspiracy theory is an example of a bad explanation because whatever happens if the events turn out bad, you can say "Well the conspiracy made them bad." If events turn out good you can say, "Well the conspirators are just biding their time and lulling us into a false sense of security," and so on. __Historically religions have been quite fertile sources of bad explanations. Also a few good ones by the way. I'm not entirely opposed to religious traditions though I am an atheist.__ So good explanations are in science. They are the alternative to just plain prediction. And I think plain prediction is not really science at all. Because if you say that x happens whenever y happens you don't know that y caused x. It could be that x caused y or that something else caused both of them. Or that since you don't understand what x and y really are since you don't have an explanation it could be that you're misinterpreting the whole thing. On the other hand when you have an explanation, when you say that not only is malaria caused by living near to swamps but it's caused by the mosquitoes that live in the swamp, and put something into you when they draw your blood, then you have an explanation that is not only useful but it can be tested and improved.

source_question: What does the concept of explanation mean in the context of understanding reality and predicting future human developments?
source_answer: An explanation is a statement of what is there in reality, and how it works and why, basically. But the important distinction is between a good explanation and a bad explanation, because explanations are two a penny, but good explanations are extremely hard to come by, and this is what the growth of knowledge is actually about. So a good explanation is one that is hard to vary while still explaining what it purports to explain. So shall I give an example? Suppose you're watching a conjuring trick, and you're trying to explain what's happening. Now an example of a bad explanation would be, "Well, it's actually magic." And the reason that that's a bad explanation is that you could apply that same explanation to absolutely anything, including to the conjuring trick happening a different way, or to a conjuring trick not happening, and so on. So that claim about reality, that it really is magic, is not actually an explanation, or if you like, it's a bad explanation. Another example of a bad explanation, just to show you that a bad explanation doesn't necessarily have to be false, it just may be completely inadequate, is to say, "Well, the conjurer did something." So that may be enlightening for a person who believes in magic, to tell them that in fact it was the conjurer that did it, but it doesn't explain the trick. And if we take by analogy with the laws of physics, and trying to explain things in the natural world, we could say, "What is the origin of species? What is the origin of adaptations in the biological world?" You could say, "Well, it's just caused by atoms." Now that's true enough, but it doesn't explain. The explanation is Darwin's theory of evolution, or rather the modern neo-Darwinist theory of evolution.

source_question: What is the significance of an explanation's properties like hard to vary and having reach in making it a good explanation, not only applicable within science?
source_answer: _Regarding risky, unexpected, and narrow,_ those are criteria that come up when trying to think more precisely what testable means. I think the important thing is that you're testing an explanation, not just a prediction. But it's also true that hard to vary means you're sticking your neck out when you try to vary it. And the few variants that survive were hard to come by. So it's perfectly true that narrow and sticking your neck out are indeed components of a good explanation and not just within science. __If you say, like Popper did, that scientific knowledge is not derived from observations, he's really sticking his neck out. He's really got to make a good case for that, for it to be taken seriously by any serious thinker about knowledge. And he does that, but can't be denied that he was sticking his neck out. So the more reach something has, the better an explanation it is, so long as it does account for what it's trying to account for. But the converse is not true. Most good explanations don't have much reach or don't have any.__ We're trying to solve the problem of how to get the delivery person to deliver it to the right door. You might have a great solution to that that's totally hard to vary, but it may not have any reach at all. It may not even reach to your neighbor. The neighbor might have a different problem with delivery. So often we succeed in making good explanations, but rarely do they have much reach. When they do, that's great because that makes them of a different order of goodness.

##### deutsch_vrag_v1
bot answer: A good explanation is a statement or set of statements that accurately describes what exists, how it behaves, and why it behaves in that way. It possesses several key characteristics that distinguish it from lesser or flawed explanations. Firstly, it is hard to vary; this means that each part of the explanation is essential for accounting for the phenomena it describes, and altering any detail would compromise its coherence or its ability to account for those phenomena. This property ensures that the explanation is specific and tightly bound to the reality it seeks to explain, rather than being a vague or easily modifiable story that could fit any number of unrelated facts.

Furthermore, a good explanation has reach, meaning it not only solves the problem it was intended to solve but also applies to and solves other problems beyond its original scope. This attribute demonstrates the explanation's depth and its connection to the underlying truths of the universe, reflecting a deep understanding of the principles at play.

In the realm of science, good explanations are distinguished by their testability through experiment or observation. They contribute to our understanding of reality by providing a framework within which predictions can be made and new knowledge can be built. They are not merely predictions themselves but offer insight into the mechanisms and principles that govern the phenomena being observed.

Moreover, good explanations are a product of the critical process of conjecture and criticism. They arise not from mere observation or the accumulation of data but from the creative process of proposing bold conjectures and subjecting them to rigorous criticism and experimental testing. This process ensures that explanations are continually refined and improved, moving closer to the truth by eliminating errors and misconceptions.

In summary, a good explanation is one that is hard to vary, has reach, is testable, and emerges from the critical process of conjecture and criticism. It provides a deep understanding of reality, transcending mere appearances to reveal the underlying principles that govern the phenomena we observe.

#### user question: what is the square root of 16?
##### deutsch_qrag_v1
bot answer: The square root of 16, while seemingly a straightforward numerical question, invites us to delve into the deeper principles of mathematics and its role in our understanding of the universe. At its core, the answer is 4, as the square root function seeks the number which, when multiplied by itself, returns the original number, in this case, 16. This mathematical truth, like the value of pi or the square root of two, is not merely a numerical fact but a gateway to understanding the fundamental structures of reality as we perceive and conceptualize it.

Mathematics, as a language of the universe, allows us to describe and predict phenomena with remarkable precision, yet it is also a product of human creativity and the quest for good explanations. The existence of square roots, irrational numbers, and complex mathematical concepts reflects the unbounded nature of human thought and our ability to reach beyond the immediate sensory experience to explain the world around us.

The question of the square root of 16, therefore, is not just about arriving at the number 4 but about appreciating the process through which we come to understand and explain mathematical truths. It underscores the importance of good explanations that are hard to vary—those that provide deep insights into the nature of reality and our place within it. These explanations, while always fallible and subject to revision, are central to the growth of knowledge and our ongoing quest to solve problems and understand the universe.

In this light, the square root of 16 is more than an answer; it is a reflection of the principles that guide our exploration of the world through reason, criticism, and the pursuit of knowledge. It exemplifies how, through the application of these principles, we can approach even the simplest questions with a sense of wonder and a deeper quest for understanding.

source_question: Could there be a world in which pi was rational or square root of two?
source_answer: _Regarding if there could be a world in which pi was rational or square root of two,_ of course, that's a fairly simple case. All it would have to do is have a different geometry from ours, not Euclidean geometry. Pi isn't instantiated in the universe anyway, it's an idealization. So if you actually measure a circle, you'll never get pi as the ratio between the radius and the diameter and the circumference. *IN-LINE: I was thinking of the mathematical pi.* Well, so there are two different things one might mean by the mathematical pi. Physics allows us a certain window onto the class of abstractions, a tiny window. We can see some of them. We can form theories about some of them. We can learn about some of them, and they include Euclidean geometry with its pi. That pi cannot be changed by anyone, not even God. Not even if we look out of a different window. But if we did look out of a different window, thanks to having different laws of physics, or if the laws of physics were not what we think they are, but are a bit different from what we think they are, as happened with Euclidean geometry and general relativity, then we won't find pi out there in the stuff we can look at. We can still describe it. We can describe pi, and we can describe the universe as it actually is, which doesn't have pi. And there will be other ones which we can't describe, but they may have people in them which can describe them. And then there'll be infinitely more where there aren't people who can describe anything. And be careful to conclude that therefore we don't exist, because that is like the anthropic principle misconception. Just because- *IN-LINE: I would say the misapplication of the anthropic principle. These places exist, but there's nobody there to complain about it.* No, but you want to use it to deduce something about the world we do see. And I don't think the anthropic principle is powerful enough to do that, because it will only, it will, the most it can do is...

source_question: What is reason?
source_answer: I think that this picture of what reason even is, is wrong. It's not a way of getting to a conclusion or of justifying a conclusion or coming from some secure thing like evidence to reach the conclusion. None of those is true. Reason is entirely critical. And which is why, it's always finding errors and correcting them, not finding a way to justify a thing and say that that's now finally the truth. That's why it has to begin with a problem. So if we have a problem, a conflict, then we know that either one side is wrong or the other side is wrong or they're both wrong, but they can't be both right. So the problem is a fertile thing in that sense because then you can begin to think about the problem. And what you're supposed to think about in the Popperian scheme of things is, "Well, if one of them is wrong, what's wrong with it?" Try to find a thing that's wrong with it, which means criticize it. Conjecture criticisms. "Well, it might be that the scientists are all lying. Okay."

source_question: What is the origin and principle behind the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm in quantum computation?
source_answer: _Regarding Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm in quantum computation,_ the first algorithm that I proposed in my first paper on universal quantum computer was in fact not the one that's called the Deutsch algorithm today. It had much less power. So I've really usurped somebody, somebody else invented the thing called the Deutsch algorithm or probably several people simultaneously. But then the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm was invented, basically, by Jozsa. He came to see me and said he wants to talk about quantum algorithms. And he showed me how you could execute something that in the end turned out to be what's called the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. And when he was halfway through his explanation, I said, "Wait a minute, that violates the theorem that I proved in my first paper, that quantum parallelism can't increase the average speed of computing anything, but can only increase the speed, the fastest speed." And so he just casually said, "Oh yeah, that was wrong." So, "Oh, my theorem was wrong. Right. Good." And the reason it was wrong is that I had what I called quantum parallelism, in that first paper, was a particular form of quantum parallelism, which was the first one I thought of and which I described in that paper. But in fact, there are many other forms and they are more powerful and in fact, exponentially more powerful. So we ended up writing the paper about that and that was the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. One way it is conceptually an improvement on my original algorithms was that it involved directly manipulating the phase and manipulating the phase is obviously a more direct way of getting to interference, which is the basis of the power of such algorithms. Some people say it's entanglement, but it's the same thing really, because you adjust the phase somewhere and you also adjust it somewhere else in the Schrödinger picture. Very misleading, but there you are, that's the Schrödinger picture for you.

source_question: What is the difference between a calculator and various types of intelligence?
source_answer: The difference between a calculator and the difference between a calculator and an AI and the difference between an AI and an AGI or human. Those are two distinct differences. One is that a calculator is essentially an automated lookup table. It consists of an algorithm that was programmed in by somebody who knew what the transformation between the inputs and outputs ought to be. Namely, when you press a certain button, it multiplies and so on. AIs, modern AIs, essentially construct their algorithm themselves from by generalizing a large amount of data. This, in early ones, this led to kind of embarrassing glitches, like when they identified, you know, a heap of rifles as a cat because somebody worked out what they were doing and how to fool them. But the modern ones use so much data and have been honed by humans so well that they rarely do this. Although I've recently been playing around with the ChatGPTs and I find that if you ask it some questions off the beaten track, you can quite easily cause it to do all the old things of either saying nonsense, contradicting itself, committing howlers where it says the opposite of known facts and so on. And that's different from human knowledge, which is explanatory. Neither the calculator nor the chatbot ever produces a new explanation. Well, you can ask it for an explanation, but all it's doing is distilling explanations that already exist. And that's the thing that it doesn't do very well either.

bot answer: The square root of 16 is 4. This mathematical truth, like all knowledge in mathematics, is a product of our best explanations of abstract reality. It represents an absolutely necessary truth within the domain of mathematics, demonstrating the inherent fallibility and error-prone nature of all knowledge. Mathematics, as a pursuit of understanding abstract realities, showcases the universal power of explanatory knowledge, enabling us to solve problems and extend our reach beyond immediate appearances to grasp the underlying principles of the universe. This specific piece of knowledge, while seemingly simple, is part of the broader tapestry of mathematical understanding that contributes to our ability to control nature, make technical progress, and prepare for unknown dangers and opportunities.

text: Yeah. Let's just let's end it there. And let's end season one there. It was 14 episodes. Yeah, I had a couple of guests who who didn't. It was gonna be 16. But we'll take a break. I don't know when we'll come back sometime later in the year. It's gonna be an awful year, I think, 2020 politically. So I'm just gonna like put on my headphones. And yeah, you have your if people want more Coleman, you're out there. Conversations, the Coleman is out there. I've been writing on what Jay thinks a bunch of essays coming out and stuff. So you'll find us. But I'm going to go out there and collect a bunch of dilemmas with interviews with people again for season two. And we'll see. I might get back more to the roots that we started with of like, here's sort of just like a trolley problem type thing. And let's solve it. I'm also interested in taking on people in sort of the political and religious realms as well, not just philosophers and psychologists. So we'll see who I can I can throw questions

text: explosions are horrendous tragedies. But we do know that a supernova devastates all the planets that may be orbiting it, wiping out all life that may exist there – including any intelligent beings, unless they have technology far superior to ours. Its neutrino radiation alone would kill a human at a range of billions of kilometres, even if that entire distance were filled with lead shielding. Yet we owe our existence to supernovae: they are the source, through transmutation, of most of the elements of which our bodies, and our planet, are composed. There are phenomena that outshine supernovae. In March 2008 an X-ray telescope in Earth orbit detected an explosion of a type known as a ‘gamma-ray burst’, 7.5 billion light years away. That is halfway across the known universe. It was probably a single star collapsing to form a black hole – an object whose gravity is so intense that not even light can escape from its interior. The explosion was intrinsically brighter than a million
