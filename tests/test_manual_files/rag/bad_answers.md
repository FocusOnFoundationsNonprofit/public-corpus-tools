QUOTED QUESTION 1: What is a good explanation?
QUOTED ANSWER 1: In The Fabric of Reality, I completely avoided saying what an explanation is. I just said it's hard to define and it keeps changing and we can keep improving our conception of what it is. But what makes an explanation good is that it meets all the criticisms that we have at the moment. If you have that, then you've got the best explanation. And that automatically implies that it already doesn't have any rivals by then. Because if it has any rivals that have anything going for them, then the existence of two different explanations for the same thing means that neither of them is the best explanation. You only have the best explanation when you've found reasons to reject the rivals. Of course, not all possible rivals, because all possible rivals include the one that's going to supersede the current best explanation. If I want to explain something, like how come the stars don't fall down, I can easily generate 60 explanations an hour and not stop and say that the angels are holding them up or they are really just holes in the firmament. Or I can say they are falling down and we better take cover soon. Whereas coming up with an explanation that contains knowledge, an explanation that's better than just making stuff up, requires both creativity and experiment and interpretation and so on. As Popper says, "Knowledge is hard to come by." Because it's hard to come by, it's also hard to change once we've got it. Once we have an explanation, it's going to explain several different things. And after we've done that for a while and been successful in this hard thing, it's going to be difficult to switch to one of those easy explanations. The angel thing is no longer going to be any good for explaining why some of those stars don't move in the same way they used to call planets stars, because they didn't know the drastic difference between them. The overwhelming majority of them move from day to day and from year to year in a rigid way, but the planets don't. So __once you have a good explanation that tells you about the planets as well, it's no good going back to the angels or any of those easy to come by explanations. So not only do you not have a viable rival, but you can't make one either. You can't say, "Oh, okay, so we got a good explanation there, but it would work just as well if we replace this by this, or if we try to extend its range to cover this other thing as well." And therefore, the good explanation is hard to vary. It's hard to vary because it was hard to come by. It's hard to come by because the easy ones don't explain much.__

QUOTED QUESTION 2: What is David Deutsch's response to the concerns about human hubris and the impact of colonization on other celestial bodies?
QUOTED ANSWER 2: __The avoidance of hubris and the glorification of humility is the thing that kept us suffering for hundreds of thousands of years. This is the guilt of which we are accused by this worldview is not, although it has some modern fashionable forms, it's actually not a new idea. It is the prevailing idea throughout most of history. And ironically, it's really the reverse is the case.__ It's not that we have polluted the earth on balance. The earth was killing us with pollution from the moment our species began. The cholera bacillus evolved to do exactly that and killed millions of people. And before human beings existed, it killed the people that were our predecessors. The biosphere killed all our cousin species, like the Neanderthals and so on. And it has only been since the invention of human technology that we have managed to lift ourselves a little way out of this.

AI ANSWER:
A good approach when talking to a six-year-old about their beliefs in Indian gods such as Ganesh is to be respectful and open-minded, while encouraging curiosity and critical thinking. Here’s a way to respond:

"Wow, that’s really interesting! Ganesh is a very special character in many stories, and lots of people find those stories very important and meaningful. It's wonderful to learn about different cultures and their beliefs. Did you know that people have lots of different ways to explain how the world works? Scientists, for example, use explanations that they test by doing experiments and looking at evidence. Everyone's way of understanding the world can be different, and it's great to learn about as many of them as we can. Let's keep thinking and asking questions—there's always more to discover!"

This response acknowledges their belief, introduces the concept of different explanations (like scientific ones), and encourages ongoing curiosity and learning.
