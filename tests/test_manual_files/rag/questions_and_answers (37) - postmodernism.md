QUOTED ANSWER 1: __Bad philosophy is a subset of bad explanations.__ False philosophy is not harmful. In fact, error is the standard state of human knowledge. We can expect to find error everywhere, including in the theories that we think are, that we most cherish as true. But there has grown up, especially since the Enlightenment, ironically, since good explanations have begun to take over, bad explanations have become worse and bad philosophy has dominated the field of philosophy for many decades. Bad philosophy is philosophy whose effect is to close off the growth of knowledge in that field. So it's the kind of thing that says not just so-and-so is true when in fact it is false, but you mustn't think about so-and-so, or it's bad to investigate so-and-so. Logical positivism is a prime example of a bad philosophy.  *IN-LINE: Which restricts your ability to even address questions as meaningless because it's not either sense data or logic or something like that.* Exactly right. So it's saying that trying to understand what the physics is of unobserved objects is unscientific, according to positivism. Now that means really that it's trying to reduce us to an anthropocentric worldview, rather like the medieval worldview, because it's saying that the only things that are worthy of study are human experiences. But of course human experiences are themselves to be understood in terms of unexperienced things like neurons. So the whole philosophy collapses, and in addition it declares itself to be meaningless because this distinction that it draws applies to itself as well and rules out positivism as a worthy subject of study.  *IN-LINE: What are other examples of bad philosophy?* The ones that are closest to my mind are the ones that have impinged on physics. So logical positivism was one example of that. But __when, in recent times, statistical analysis of experimental results has started to use terminology that assumes that certain things will never be worth studying. So for example, the very term explanation has come to mean a mathematical formula. They say a mathematical formula explains the results. But since the results are anthropocentric and they are not reality, they're just a tiny sliver of reality through which we are trying to understand the unobserved reality, this idea that a formula is an explanation prevents real explanations from being discovered. They are ruled illegitimate.__

### QUOTED QUESTION 2: How dangerous is postmodernism to civilization?

QUOTED ANSWER 2: _Regarding efforts to fight the influence of postmodernism,_ I think it's very important. At the moment, the postmodern attack on civilization is probably the most dangerous of the intellectual attacks. I can't quantify how much danger there is of nuclear war at the moment. Obviously, that would be worse if it happened. But apart from physical danger, I think in the long run, the intellectual danger is probably worse because if there's nothing to defend, then it doesn't matter if we give in to nuclear blackmail or whatever.

### AI ANSWER:
Postmodernism is a broad intellectual movement that emerged in the mid-20th century as a reaction against the ideas and values of modernism, particularly its confidence in progress, science, and objective truth. Postmodernism is characterized by a skeptical attitude towards grand narratives and ideologies, questioning the notions of fixed meanings, identities, and objective realities. It often emphasizes the relative and subjective nature of knowledge, suggesting that what we consider to be "truth" is influenced by social, cultural, and historical contexts.

Key aspects of postmodernism include:

1. **Relativism:** Postmodernism argues that perspectives and interpretations are relative and contingent upon various factors, rejecting the idea of a single, universal truth.
2. **Deconstruction:** It involves analyzing and deconstructing texts and ideas to reveal hidden biases, contradictions, and assumptions.
3. **Fragmentation:** Postmodern thought often highlights the fragmented and decentralized nature of reality, rejecting unified, coherent explanations.
4. **Pastiche and Parody:** In art and literature, postmodernism often employs pastiche, parody, and playfulness, mixing different styles and genres to challenge traditional boundaries.
5. **Skepticism of Meta-Narratives:** Postmodernism is skeptical of overarching stories or "meta-narratives" that claim to explain historical or social phenomena comprehensively, such as Marxism or the Enlightenment rationalism.

David Deutsch views postmodernism as particularly dangerous because it attacks fundamental concepts like objective truth and progress, which are vital for the growth of knowledge and the advancement of civilization. He argues that postmodernism's intellectual influence can undermine efforts to solve problems and defend against more immediate, physical dangers, such as nuclear threats.
