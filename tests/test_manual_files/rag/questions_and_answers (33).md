QUOTED ANSWER 1: I don't think mathematical truth is syntactical. Well, in that respect, I'm a Platonist or something. __I think there are mathematical objects out there, only in a different sense to the sense in which there are physical objects out there, but you have to distinguish between the necessary features of the things that are out there and the method by which we find out about them. In the case of the mathematical truths, we definitely only have access to an infinitesimal proportion of them. But with physical truths, we seem to have access. There's nothing that seems fundamentally hidden from us.__

### QUOTED QUESTION 2: What is the Mathematician's Misconception about the fundamentals of mathematics?

QUOTED ANSWER 2: _The Mathematician's Misconception about the fundamentals of mathematics_ is __the idea that the integers and the logical operations like and, or, and not are given to us by God. They are the natural things. And if you can make some, build some structure or form some conclusion on top of those, then you have proved it. Whereas the real truth is that the integers and the logical connectives and classical rules of inference and all that, they are all given to us by physics alone. There is no underlying mathematical substrate that we can appeal to. If the laws of physics were different, then we could have laws of physics that didn't mention and, or, and not, or integers or real numbers. They could use any mathematical objects anywhere in the mathematical world. But the fact that they don't is a feature of the laws of physics.__ With this misconception comes some other misconceptions such as, for example, that simplicity is somehow defined independently of the laws of physics. And infinity as well. As I have written, Zeno was puzzled by the fact that there's an infinite number of points between here and the other side of the room. And how come that he can go from one point to another? How come he can do an infinite number of things in a finite time? Well, the answer is that what is finite or infinite physically, its relationship to mathematical finiteness or infinite is a matter for the laws of physics to determine. And they happen to say that this particular infinite thing in classical physics, the continuum, can be traversed. An infinite number of steps of traversing it can be finitely performed. So what can be finitely performed or not, or conversely, what can only be infinitely performed, i.e. can't be performed, is mandated by the laws of physics, and not vice versa. So it's physics that tells us the difference between find an infinite, complex and simple. And also probability, which is which is a sort of scam lodged in the in the middle of all these misconceptions. *IN-LINE: Is it a meta misconception?* There is simply a misconception that probability is another one of these concepts that we can help ourselves to, and we haven't yet invoked any physics. We would like what we see to have at least 0.83 probability, then we won't worry that it's strange. And that invocation of probability we take to be sort of harmless. We don't see that there's a rich world of physics defining what we mean by that. And in the case of probability, unlike the other things, it doesn't even apply to to most of the universe or the multiverse. It just applies to very special situations. There's no excuse for it. *IN-LINE: If I would have been asked, "What's the mathematician misconception?" In a nutshell, I would have said, it's the idea that proof theory is a branch of mathematics, but proof theory is a branch of physics ultimately. It's been... It's given rise to computer science. Computer science has its roots into what are computers. Computers are physical objects. Now, the story you just gave us, you started speaking of natural numbers and logical connectors. How can I bridge those two pictures of the mathematician misconception?*  Well, they are the same, I think. *IN-LINE: Maybe I'm giving a try and then tell me. Because we typically do proofs with typical logical connectors and that will give rise to somehow our computers, so that we end up abstracting our computers with those logical connectors and those integers. And that's where you say that taking this as a way to formalize proof is basically physical because I'm already abstracting my physics of the computation.*  Yes. I think that's basically what I said. I'm not really used to speaking in mathematical language. So I speak of it in terms of laws of physics. So I think, probably, Turing never said this, but I'm sure if he was here now, he would agree that proof theory is a branch of physics.

### AI ANSWER:
David Deutsch’s perspective on the nature of mathematics intertwines deeply with his views on physics and reality. To answer the broad question, "What is math?" by leveraging Deutsch's philosophy, it’s essential to explore both his ideas on mathematical truths and his critique of common mathematician misconceptions.

### Mathematical Truths and Objects
According to David Deutsch, mathematical truths are not merely syntactical or abstract constructs. He aligns somewhat with Platonism, suggesting that mathematical objects and truths exist out there, but in a different sense than physical objects do. As he mentions in QUOTED ANSWER 1:

> **"I think there are mathematical objects out there, only in a different sense to the sense in which there are physical objects out there, but you have to distinguish between the necessary features of the things that are out there and the method by which we find out about them."**

Deutsch suggests that while we have access to an infinitesimal proportion of mathematical truths, the methods by which we discover them differ from those we use to explore physical truths.

### Critique of Mathematician's Misconception
Deutsch deeply critiques the conventional views held by many mathematicians regarding the foundational nature of mathematics. In QUOTED ANSWER 2, he argues that integers, logical operations, and other mathematical constructs are not divine or fundamental truths handed down to us but are given by the laws of physics. He states:

> **"The integers and the logical connectives and classical rules of inference and all that, they are all given to us by physics alone. There is no underlying mathematical substrate that we can appeal to."**

He extends this argument to notions of simplicity, infinity, and even probability, viewing them all as concepts ultimately defined by the laws of physics rather than existing in a mathematical vacuum:

> **"It's physics that tells us the difference between finite and infinite, complex and simple."**

### Synthesis and Understanding
From Deutsch's perspective, mathematics is deeply intertwined with physical reality. It's not an independent realm of abstract truths but a set of ideas and structures emerging from and deeply connected to the physical world. He sees mathematics as a subset of the broader tapestry of physical laws that govern our universe, suggesting that changes in these laws could fundamentally alter the mathematical truths we perceive.

### Conclusion
In summary, according to David Deutsch:
- Mathematics is a collection of truths and structures that exist in a realm connected to but distinct from the physical world.
- These mathematical truths are deeply informed and shaped by the laws of physics.
- The objects and results of mathematics are not merely abstract or divine but are products of the underlying physical reality.

Thus, math, in the lens of Deutsch’s philosophy, is both a discovery and a creation shaped by the physical framework of our universe.

### QUOTED QUESTION 1: What does existence mean in the context of science and the mystery of consciousness?
QUOTED SOURCE: 2023-10-15_Deutsch Files 3 with Naval and Brett_qafixed.md
QUOTED TIMESTAMP 1: [54:34](https://youtu.be/fizPWAAo-lc&t=3274)
QUOTED ANSWER 1: Well, I think it's important to give up on the idea of ultimate explanation. So often when people say, the mystery of existence, what is existence? What are we ultimately? __Well, if there was such a thing as knowing what we are ultimately, then you'd have to stop after that. The further delights from understanding the world would be closed to you because you'd know what your ultimate purpose is.__ However, __I think it's totally untrue that science just looks at the details. Science looks at the big picture of every kind. Science has discovered what is life. One day, science will discover what is consciousness. And people who think that you understand consciousness when you get into a certain state of mind that makes you happy, they are the ones that are focusing on details and not understanding the big picture, not understanding the context.__ This reminds me of that video that Feynman made about his art friend who tells him he's missing what's important about a flower. And he basically says, "No, I can appreciate the flower as much as this guy, but he can't appreciate what I can appreciate." And __that's a kind of false stereotype that science only looks at details or science only looks at the mechanical or science only looks at the meaningless things and never gets around to looking at the meaning of things. What they're really pointing to is that science uncovers problems when it discovers something new. And just in the big picture, we know a lot more about who and what we are and why, than we did a hundred years ago, and certainly than we did at the time of the founding of the great religions, Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism and so on. They were hampered by the fact that they didn't even know what the Sun is. They were hampered by the fact that they were confusing the world with one planet.__ And in fact, environmentalists today, __I just happened to see yesterday that environmentalists say that they want to get in touch with nature. And by nature, they mean certain regions on the surface of one planet. But nature doesn't know about those prejudices. Nature exists on all planets, and the important thing about this planet is us, not the grass and the fields.__ So yeah, there are many mystical and religious worldviews. Some of them do capture something about the human condition in that they can make people happy, at least in a limited way, they can make some people happy some of the time. And different religions can do this. And your Oxford friend may or may not think that he has the same knowledge as the people in the Bible belt of the U.S. who sit around in a circle and sing Kumbaya. But they are also smiling all the time, and they think that they've got it, and he thinks that he's got it. And to some extent they must have something because they can make people happy. There's this quote in one of the great chess players of the early 20th century, it goes like this, "Chess, like music, like love, has the power to make men happy." Okay, he's got a sliver of truth there. There is an important truth in there. But he hasn't actually understood happiness, or men, or how to achieve anything in the way of making men happy. He's just got a sliver of truth and I don't think that chess player thought of this as being the truth. But __the Kumbaya people and maybe your person think that they've got the truth, the whole truth, the final truth about this, and they definitely haven't.__

### QUOTED QUESTION 2: What is meaning of life, the significance of our existence?
QUOTED SOURCE: 2011-10-01_What Now interview with Ken Rose_qafixed.md
QUOTED TIMESTAMP 2: [20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjg0hnITUio&t=1216)
QUOTED ANSWER 2: _Regarding the significance of our existence,_ this has to do with both moral and aesthetic values. What we're trying to do, even though many people try to deny this, they deny that they are seeking, trying to do what is right or trying to create what is actually beautiful and so on. But that is what we're trying to do, and that is the meaning. Religions traditionally thought that the meaning was already known or had been revealed to humans and that what our task is, is to live up to that, to enact it. My view is the other way around, that __the meaning of life is something that we are using creativity to discover, to build. There isn't a perfectly accurate word for what we're doing, but we can't find the meaning of life in the world out there, nor just by pure thought or by reference to an authority. What we have to do is form explanations about what is right and wrong, what is better and worse, what's beautiful and ugly, and hone those theories while also trying to meet them. At any one moment, we will meet them imperfectly, just like scientific theories at any one moment are only an imperfect explanation of what the physical world is like. But through criticism and conjecture and seeking the truth, we can eliminate the errors in what we had previously thought and thereby make progress. And that is trying to find the meaning of life, trying to create the meaning of life is the meaning of life.__ *IN-LINE: So we want to model and articulate reality.* Yes, both moral, aesthetic, as well as abstract and physical reality. Yes, exactly.

### AI ANSWER:
David Deutsch's perspective on the meaning of life emphasizes the role of creativity and continuous discovery. He suggests that the meaning of life is not something pre-determined or revealed by an external authority. Instead, it is something that we actively create and discover through our own efforts.

Deutsch argues that the process of finding meaning involves forming and refining explanations about what is right and wrong, what is beautiful and ugly, and what is better and worse. This process is iterative, involving conjecture, criticism, and the elimination of errors over time. Just as scientific theories evolve to better explain the physical world, our understanding of moral, aesthetic, and existential questions evolves through the same methodical approach.

In summary, the meaning of life, according to Deutsch, lies in our ongoing endeavor to create and improve our understanding of the world and our place in it, through the application of creativity and reason. This continuous journey of discovery and improvement is, in itself, the meaning of life.
