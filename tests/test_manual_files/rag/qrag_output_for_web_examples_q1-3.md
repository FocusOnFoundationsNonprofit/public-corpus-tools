QUOTED QUESTION 1: What does it mean to know everything?
QUOTED ANSWER 1: When I was a child, I remember being told that in the distant past, a very learned person might hope to understand everything that was understood. Whereas now because of specialization, because so much is known, that's impossible. That one person can only understand a very small fraction of what's known. And I really didn't believe this, I didn't want to believe this. And I envied the ancient scholars who might have aspired to knowing everything that was known at the time. And what I meant by, "knowing everything that was known," or "understanding everything that was understood," is not that they knew in detail everything that happened, that they had lists of things which they remembered. That's very far from what I meant. I meant that they understood all the explanations that were known. And I believe that we are not heading away from an era in which one might understand all the explanations as they're known, but towards it, because we are continually unifying and broadening and deepening our explanations of the world.

QUOTED QUESTION 2: What is meaning of life, the significance of our existence?
QUOTED ANSWER 2: _Regarding the significance of our existence,_ this has to do with both moral and aesthetic values. What we're trying to do, even though many people try to deny this, they deny that they are seeking, trying to do what is right or trying to create what is actually beautiful and so on. But that is what we're trying to do, and that is the meaning. Religions traditionally thought that the meaning was already known or had been revealed to humans and that what our task is, is to live up to that, to enact it. My view is the other way around, that __the meaning of life is something that we are using creativity to discover, to build. There isn't a perfectly accurate word for what we're doing, but we can't find the meaning of life in the world out there, nor just by pure thought or by reference to an authority. What we have to do is form explanations about what is right and wrong, what is better and worse, what's beautiful and ugly, and hone those theories while also trying to meet them. At any one moment, we will meet them imperfectly, just like scientific theories at any one moment are only an imperfect explanation of what the physical world is like. But through criticism and conjecture and seeking the truth, we can eliminate the errors in what we had previously thought and thereby make progress. And that is trying to find the meaning of life, trying to create the meaning of life is the meaning of life.__ *IN-LINE: So we want to model and articulate reality.* Yes, both moral, aesthetic, as well as abstract and physical reality. Yes, exactly.

AI ANSWER:
According to David Deutsch, the meaning of life is not something that is pre-determined or externally dictated, but rather something that we actively construct through our own creative processes. Deutsch expresses that the significance of our existence involves engaging with moral and aesthetic values, which are not fixed, but are subject to our continuous exploration and refinement. We don't find the meaning of life merely by observing the world or adhering to established authorities, but by forming our own explanations and theories about what is right and wrong, and what is beautiful and ugly. This creative exploration helps us discover and build the meaning of life. Thus, the meaning of life, as described by Deutsch, is the continuous, dynamic process of creating and understanding these values, and striving to manifest them in our lives, even though our understanding and execution will be imperfect at times. As we critique, conjecture, and seek truth, we make progress by eliminating errors in our previous understandings, which is fundamentally how we create the meaning of life.

USER QUESTION: What should I eat for lunch?

Your question is not addressed in David Deutsch's interviews. No QUOTED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS are therefore provided but here is an AI ANSWER that synthesizes David Deutsch's philosophy and your question.

AI ANSWER:
Drawing upon David Deutsch's philosophy of deep optimism, which emphasizes the power of knowledge and our ability to solve problems through creative thinking, deciding what to eat for lunch can be approached with an optimistic and innovative mindset. Consider choosing a meal that not only nourishes your body but also expands your culinary experiences or aligns with sustainable practices, reflecting progress and positive impact. Opt for foods that are nutritious, perhaps trying a new recipe or ingredient to spark creativity and enjoyment in your meal, thus aligning with Deutsch's views on the power of new knowledge and innovation in everyday life.

USER QUESTION: What are computers and computation at a deep level?

There is a good match of your question in David Deutsch's interviews. See his QUOTED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS below followed by an AI ANSWER that synthesizes these quotes with David Deutsch's philosophy and your exact question.

QUOTED QUESTION: What are computers and computation at a deep level?
QUOTED ANSWER: A theory of computation within any laws of physics is the theory of how you can use physical objects to represent abstract objects. So you want to represent the integers, 1, 2, 3, and you can use physical objects like fingers to say that will be 1, that's called 2, that's called 3, and so on. And __computers are ways of instantiating abstract objects and their relationships in physical objects and their motion.__ So now what happens with quantum computers is that we simply take the deepest physical theory we have, quantum theory, and we say "What kind of information processing does quantum theory in general allow and what does it not allow?" And that's the theory of quantum computation.

AI ANSWER:
At a deep level, computers and computation involve using physical objects to represent and process abstract objects such as numbers and operations. Essentially, computers function as a means of embodying abstract concepts and their relationships into the physical movement and organization of these physical objects. This enables the performance of various computational tasks. When considering quantum computers, this principle extends to exploiting the properties of quantum theory, the most fundamental physical theory available, to understand and expand the limits of what kind of information processing is possible under these principles.

QUOTED QUESTION 2: What makes life worthwhile?

QUOTED ANSWER 2: _Regarding what makes life worthwhile,_ you think I'm going to say "having fun," but having fun is not a specific thing. So it's different for everybody. Everybody has their own problem situation. Everybody has their own impediments to solving things and to having fun. And everybody has hangups and ways in which their thinking is imperfect. And so, I think the meaning of life is to remove those impediments and go towards the things that solve your problems and to seek richer problems and so on. I say all these things, but I couldn't put it better than the way Popper put it. I think he says the way to do science and philosophy, but I would extend this as the way just to live life in general, is to find a problem, fall in love with it. And then, well, you can look up what he says. He says it very beautifully. And then if you should happen to solve it. Now, I like the way he says, "If you should solve it," he kind of assumes that normally you won't solve it. And that's great. And almost solving it might be regarded as a bit of a disaster. But he says, __"No, it's not a disaster because if you happen to solve it, it will have lots of delightful problem children, enchanting problem children."__ I think he says. So I think I've got to go with his answer.

### AI ANSWER
AI Synthesized Answer: According to David Deutsch, the meaning of life is not preset or revealed from an external authority, but rather it is something that we actively construct and discover through our creative efforts. Deutsch posits that we seek to understand and define moral and aesthetic values — what is right, wrong, beautiful, and ugly — by forming explanations and refining these understandings over time through processes of criticism, conjecture, and the pursuit of truth. This ongoing endeavor to refine our values and explanations is essentially what gives life its meaning, making the creation of meaning an integral part of life itself.

Additionally, Deutsch emphasizes the importance of addressing personal challenges and barriers, suggesting that life becomes meaningful through the process of overcoming these obstacles and engaging deeply with problems that matter to us. Inspired by philosopher Karl Popper, Deutsch points out that the journey towards solving these problems, and even the generation of new problems from solutions, provides profound satisfaction and significance, enriching the overall experience of life.

In summary, for Deutsch, the meaning of life revolves around the continuous creation and refinement of our understanding of the universe, our values, and problems through active intellectual and practical engagement. This dynamic and individualized process gives life its significance and purpose.
