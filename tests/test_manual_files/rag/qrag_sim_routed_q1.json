So often when people say, the mystery of existence, what is existence? What are we ultimately? __Well, if there was such a thing as knowing what we are ultimately, then you'd have to stop after that.

What they're really pointing to is that science uncovers problems when it discovers something new.

What we're trying to do, even though many people try to deny this, they deny that they are seeking, trying to do what is right or trying to create what is actually beautiful and so on. But that is what we're trying to do, and that is the meaning.

There isn't a perfectly accurate word for what we're doing, but we can't find the meaning of life in the world out there, nor just by pure thought or by reference to an authority. What we have to do is form explanations about what is right and wrong, what is better and worse, what's beautiful and ugly, and hone those theories while also trying to meet them. At any one moment, we will meet them imperfectly, just like scientific theories at any one moment are only an imperfect explanation of what the physical world is like. But through criticism and conjecture and seeking the truth, we can eliminate the errors in what we had previously thought and thereby make progress.

        "ai_answer": "David Deutsch's perspective on the meaning of life emphasizes a dynamic and evolving understanding, rather than a static or revealed truth. According to Deutsch, the meaning of life is not something that is predetermined or given to us by an external authority. Instead, it is something we actively create and discover through our use of creativity and reason. Here are the key points of his view:\n\n1. **Creativity and Discovery**:\n   - Deutsch asserts that the meaning of life involves using our creativity to discover and build what is right, beautiful, and meaningful.\n   - The process of discovering and creating meaning is ongoing and never final. We continuously form explanations about moral, aesthetic, and other values, and refine these through criticism and conjecture.\n\n2. **Progress through Criticism**:\n   - Similar to scientific theories, our ideas about the meaning of life are imperfect and subject to improvement.\n   - By identifying and eliminating errors in our previous thoughts, we make progress in understanding and creating the meaning of life.\n\n3. **Opposition to Static or Revealed Meaning**:\n   - Traditional religious views often suggest that the meaning of life is already known or revealed and that our task is merely to live up to that predetermined meaning.\n   - Deutsch challenges this view, proposing instead that meaning is not found \"out there\" in the world or dictated by any authority, but is crafted through human endeavor and the pursuit of truth.\n\n4. **Integration of Various Realities**:\n   - The search for meaning involves modeling and articulating both moral and aesthetic realities, as well as abstract and physical ones.\n  \nThe essence of Deutsch's philosophy on the meaning of life can be summarized as: **The meaning of life is the process of striving to create and discover meaning through creativity, reason, and continuous improvement in our explanations of moral, aesthetic, and broader existential questions.**",
