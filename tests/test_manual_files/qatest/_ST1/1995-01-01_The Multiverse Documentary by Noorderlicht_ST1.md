FLAG: Speaker transitions errors detected.

1. Near the beginning of David Deutsch's segment, there is a potential speaker transition error with overlap of speech. The phrase "Suppose you take one of the classic experiments of quantum mechanics, for instance, the prediction of the interference of light" seems to be part of the explanation by David Deutsch, yet it is directly attached to the question asked by the previous speaker. The correct transition should be after the question:

   - **Incorrect:** Unknown [4:49] But why would we need multiple universes? David Deutsch [4:53] Suppose you take one of the classic experiments...
   - **Suggested Correction:** Unknown [4:49] But why would we need multiple universes? [Speaker transition to David Deutsch] David Deutsch [4:53] Suppose you take one of the classic experiments...

All other transitions within this segment appear to be correct, with no further speaker changes indicated. The rest of the passage maintains clarity of the single speaker, David Deutsch, as he elaborates on the topic without interruption.

FLAG: Speaker transition issue.

- The change should be at "[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDZ454K_lBY&t=649) Making thousands of parallel universes?" This text currently does not attribute the question to a specific speaker. It should likely either specify who is asking the question or be incorporated into David Deutsch's following segment if he is the one posing the question rhetorically.

The correction would depend on who is speaking. If it's Unknown speaker, it should be attributed correctly, for example:
```
Unknown [10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDZ454K_lBY&t=649)
Making thousands of parallel universes?

David Deutsch [10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDZ454K_lBY&t=651)
And that means there must be at least thousands of parallel universes...
```
If David Deutsch is asking the question rhetorically as part of his explanation, it should be:
```
David Deutsch [10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDZ454K_lBY&t=649)
Making thousands of parallel universes? And that means there must be at least thousands of parallel universes...
```

FLAG: Speaker Transition Error

Location: End of Speaker 2's segment and the beginning of David Deutsch's segment.

Change: Speaker 2's segment at [13:22] ends with a question mark, which could possibly lead to confusion as if the same speaker continues talking. To clarify the speaker transition, it would be beneficial to indicate when David Deutsch starts speaking. For instance:

Speaker 2 [13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDZ454K_lBY&t=797)
What makes me go into multiple copies in multiple universes?

David Deutsch [13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDZ454K_lBY&t=802)
You already exist in multiple copies. Initially, they are all identical....
