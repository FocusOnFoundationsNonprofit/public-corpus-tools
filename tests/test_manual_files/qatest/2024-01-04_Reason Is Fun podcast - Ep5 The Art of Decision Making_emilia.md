Summary  [0:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=2)
Mark Alexander is a facilitator and producer of Art of Accomplishment's Great Decisions course. He talks to Lulie Tanett about decision making, hang-ups and mental blocks.

Summary  [4:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=267)
The author says that morality is inbuilt in the creative being. He says that it can be navigated through looking at what do I want.

Summary  [8:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=517)
Many decisions don't have this kind of conflict in the first place. We think in terms of game theory and decision theory and of probabilities and utilities and that kind of this has entered the culture. We retrospectively frame decision-making as being this game-theoretic process, which does not include any creativity.

Summary  [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=775)
"hang-ups might have been originally caused by pain, but I think always, but you know, I don't claim to understand the human mind" "Some of the ideas are inexplicit or unconscious often one isn't aware of what they are or What they were but they they participate in the unconscious process that does this sabotaging thing"

Summary  [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1040)
L. L. Martin: I try to avoid decision-making. I might have a problem and I might be seeking the solution. This doesn't usually look like having an array of solutions. But I'm generally speaking, I only have one kind of thing I want.

Summary  [21:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1296)
Mark Manson: I think that fun, the state of mind that we call fun is intimately connected with creativity. It's un-bulked creativity. That's what fun is.

Summary  [25:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1559)
Suffering is simply distracting and is therefore another thing that prevents proper thought from happening. If there's nothing you know of, like a cup of tea or a hug or a run or whatever, that will reduce your suffering, then you can't. You have to do it another way.

Summary  [30:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1819)
I say I switch to theory because I always want to stress that none of these things are sources of knowledge or rather they're not infallible. None of them are privileged as knowing what the answer if you don't. They could all be mistaken. Would you consider emotions as a source of knowledge?

Lulie Tanett  [0:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=2)
Welcome to the Reason Is Fun podcast. I'm your host, Lulie Tanett, and it's an unusual one today because following the episode on decisions, I have one of the facilitators and producer of Art of Accomplishment's Great Decisions course, Mark Alexander. So it's a three-way conversation about decision making, hang-ups or mental blocks, and what to do when one encounters them. I really loved Mark's questions and it was a pleasure to have this conversation. Enjoy!

Mark Alexander  [0:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=33)
I listened to the episode that you recorded with Lulie and there was a few things that kind of piqued my interest. One of them was around competing wants, where I think you were talking about ice cream and different flavors of ice cream or something to that effect. And there was this notion that you can want the ice cream, but you can also not want it. And so you have these competing wants inside. And when I think of that, it takes me into kind of the realm of shoulds. And I wanted to see how that squares with you and how that fits in.

David Deutsch  [1:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=64)
As with many words and concepts in everyday language, should has two pretty opposite meanings. One of them is, I could say, it's the proposed solution of a problem, namely the problem of what to do next, which is a problem faced by any creative entity. So to be creative, creativity comes from solving problems and all life is problem solving and the problem is at least two competing theories. And so in that sense, when I say I should do so-and-so, that ought to be, should be the conclusion of a creative process, which at the beginning did not have, had many possible outcomes. So that's one way of looking at should the other way of looking at should and if I it's often connected with other people but to keep it uniform. Let me think of it again as just being inside one mind where you're saying? To cut a long story short you're saying I want to do so and so, but I should, I shouldn't. So in the case of the ice cream, it would be that I want the ice cream, but I shouldn't. And existing culture kind of thinks that this is what morality is about, this is what life is about. As Michael Lockwood said to me once, morality is the theory of, let me get this right, the theory of why you don't do what you would do if you didn't know about morality. So his idea is, if it weren't for our theories of morality, there'd be a thing that we would do, like we would do the animal thing or the base thing or the... But because we have moral theories we don't do those anyway despite in some sense wanting to do them. Now, I think that is a description of what happens when moral thinking goes wrong it's a very bad way of of characterizing moral thinking in general.

Mark Alexander  [3:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=210)
Yeah, what's what's wrong with it?

David Deutsch  [3:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=211)
Well, it it envisages a perpetual unresolvable conflict and, you know, that that's the definition of hell or something, you know that that's, I mean, you know, it's never exactly that that's oversimplification of what the prevailing view of morality is, because I think the prevailing view also includes the idea that one can want to do the moral thing. It's not quite as the same as saying one can want to be moral because according to Michael Lockwood's definition that want can co-exist with another want to be immoral.

Lulie Tanett  [4:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=255)
I have a question about the should thing, which was that... So you said that should was something like at the end of a creative process, that's the, whatever, best answer that you've got. 

David Deutsch  [4:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=267)
Well, that's the answer, which has solved the problem for the moment.

Lulie Tanett  [4:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=272)
In what sense is it should that thing? Why do you need the word should in the first place? 

David Deutsch  [4:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=277)
Because it's not a factual statement. It's not a statement so-and-so is true. It's a statement that so-and-so should be true. If it isn't true now, we'll make it true.

Lulie Tanett  [4:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=288)
How come you can't just say I want to do such and such?

David Deutsch  [4:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=292)
Yes, but you need an explanation. I mean, you have an explanation. You've just worked out quite possibly a complicated explanation for why you now want this. And so there's something extra. It's beyond just wants. You had wants at the beginning. At the end you have a want and you found that by considering morality.

Mark Alexander  [5:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=315)
Hey like as though the morality is driving the want?

David Deutsch  [5:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=320)
Yes, absolutely. It always does. That's another thing, you know, thinking it's the other way around is another of the misconceptions about morality that's built into our culture.

Mark Alexander  [5:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=330)
I think I see it. Okay. So when I when I think of morality the word morality the way it's being used I was thinking of it as like an extra layer being laid on top of like It's a layer of shoulds. I think of it as a layer of shoulds. I think what you're saying is not that It's saying that morality is inbuilt in the creative being. Is that a fair statement?

David Deutsch  [5:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=353)
Yes, yes, yes. And it's built into the faculty of having wants in the first place, because a human, any creative entity, has got problems, i.e. Conflicting theories, conflicting ideas, conflicting wants, conflicting moralities. We think about morality in order to solve these moral problems which we have by virtue of our nature as creative beings.

Mark Alexander  [6:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=383)
Ah, so one thing I see there is when you're in that the inquiry could be one of because this is inbuilt it can be navigated through looking at what do I want. And there's another way of navigating it, which is purely intellectual based on kind of the text of what this morality is supposed to be.

David Deutsch  [6:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=403)
I think that's not quite, I wouldn't quite put it like that, although, you know, one could put it like that. Let's say you're having a vaccination and you feel the needle going in and you have an inborn tendency to wince, that is to pull your arm away. But you want the vaccination to go well. So one way you can think about this is that you've decided you should have a vaccination and therefore your want to wince should be overridden. And you should just power through and do it anyway. But I think that for most people, you know, we call people who haven't been able to be rational about this issue, we call them, you know, needle phobic or whatever. I'm very sympathetic with that.

Mark Alexander  [7:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=462)
So what's happening in the resolution of this conflict? You know, somehow you're seeing this whole vision, you're saying, well, I want the vaccination and like, this hurts. So you have these two conflicting things, these two conflicting feelings, two conflicting wants. I want to get this injection and I don't want to get this injection.

David Deutsch  [8:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=482)
It's often the way, by the way, if you view an apparently intractable problem just from a different angle, like I say sometimes, you go and climb a hill and look at the problem from a different vantage point. It's not that the hill is part of the solution. It's that the different perspective on the problem makes it a different problem and therefore one that maybe can be solved.

Mark Alexander  [8:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=509)
In your formulation, solutions and decisions, what do they have in common And how are they different?

David Deutsch  [8:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=517)
So if a decision is problematic, then you can say the process of, you know, rationally reaching the right choice, making the right decision, is a process of solving a problem. But I think many decisions don't have this kind of conflict in the first place. I think they are many decisions, like I said, in the podcast with Lulie, because nowadays we think in terms of game theory and decision theory and of probabilities and utilities and that kind of this has entered the culture. It's not that old. I think it only entered the culture like after World War II. We retrospectively frame decision-making as being this game-theoretic process, which, by the way, does not include any creativity. It doesn't involve any actual solving of problems. It's all kind of mathematical. You can end up saying, you know, yes I want to do A and not B because A outweighs B, that doesn't go anywhere towards solving the problem. Well, it might go some way towards it, but there you're still left with a problem. And you know, doing A when you still want to do B, may be very unpleasant, it may be traumatic. Oh, this is great, this is great. Doing A when you want to do A and no longer want to do B, that's a solution. Mm-hmm. If there was a problem, but often, you know, when we're choosing, so-called choosing in a restaurant from a menu what to have for dinner, it's not really accurate to say that the different meals on the menu are choices which you are weighing. You want to have dinner and you're trying to find a nice dinner to have. And then you find it and you have it. And nowhere did this resemble a scan of the menu, a construction of the utilities, a construction of the probabilities, and so on. 

Mark Alexander  [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=652)
Right, this game theoretic approach. And what was the role of creativity in that? How was that different from the game theoretic approach to the same problem?

David Deutsch  [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=661)
So in the game theory view, the options are fixed and the utilities are fixed. There is no game theory for how you change your utilities. They are permanently attached to the options and there's no acknowledgement that a new option can be created I mean, you know, it might be acknowledged in the paragraph before all the equations, but that paragraph if it's honest will say we are not analyzing the issue of where the preferences come from, where the utilities come from, where our estimates of the probabilities come from. We're assuming those are all given and will not change.

Mark Alexander  [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=699)
Right. And it's creativity that's required to introduce the new possibilities.

David Deutsch  [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=705)
Yes. Yes.

Mark Alexander  [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=707)
Now, with creativity, we could theoretically create anything, an infinite number of new options, which seems also unhelpful. Yes. What do you suppose guides that process?

David Deutsch  [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=721)
Well, it's always in response to a problem. So for a start, what guides it is we're thinking of possible candidate solutions to the problem. By the way, when one is stuck on a problem, this search for candidate solutions goes around in circles. So you keep coming back to the same thing. What about so and so? Could, oh no that doesn't work. What about this? No that doesn't work. And then you go back to the beginning and you have sort of cyclic thoughts. Because if it weren't, If that weren't so, then either you'd be spiraling upwards to and find a solution, or you'd be spiraling downwards into a state of despair. And both those things can happen, but if you're stuck, then whatever is causing this stuckness, the hangup, is creating stasis or circularity.

Mark Alexander  [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=774)
What exactly is a hangup? Because I heard you use it, and I really appreciated your use of it, but it got me wondering, wait a second, I don't think I understand exactly what he means by hang up.

David Deutsch  [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=784)
Well, it's a process which operates in parallel with other processes that are perhaps trying to solve problems and it sabotages them. So it sabotages, either it sabotages the creative process by or it sabotages the critical process or maybe those are both the same thing because At any rate it installs something that knocks down every no, it's not they're not quite the same thing knocking down creative process means criticizing absolutely everything. Whatever comes up, it's going to be criticized and by the same criterion, and it's painful. So you want to get away from that.

Lulie Tanett  [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=828)
Are hang-ups always kept in place by pain?

David Deutsch  [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=833)
No, they might have been originally caused by pain, but I think always, but you know, I don't claim to understand the human mind. If I did, I could make AGI and I can't.

Lulie Tanett  [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=847)
So there are some people who are okay with pain. Yeah, well, it's not pain.

Mark Alexander  [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=851)
What about if we use the word suffering?

David Deutsch  [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=854)
Yes, yes. So it's always caused by suffering, I think. You know, I can't swear to that, but I'm guessing. It's always originally caused by suffering. But then, once it gets entrenched, it can become part of one's personality, so that one can have these circular type of thoughts without it ever actually being painful. What happens is that you're kind of fearing the pain, but that's not right either because fear is also suffering. But it's kind of, you're chronically avoiding the pain and you've succeeded in never feeling it.

Lulie Tanett  [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=892)
Fear with resistance is suffering.

David Deutsch  [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=896)
Is that right? Yeah, quite possibly, yes.

Mark Alexander  [14:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=899)
What did these hangups have to do with emotions. How do you see that they interact?

David Deutsch  [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=907)
Okay, well, as in the case, again, as in the case of phobias, like needle phobia and so on, The ideas that are in conflict are not all explicit. They're not all of the form, you know, I want to do A, but if I do that then this will hurt and, you know, it's not like that. It's some of the ideas are inexplicit or unconscious often one isn't aware of what they are or What they were but they they participate in the unconscious process that does this sabotaging thing

Lulie Tanett  [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=944)
Would you say somatic?

David Deutsch  [15:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=946)
I don't know. I mean perhaps you would say somatic but I don't have such a clear picture of unconscious processes or inexplicit processes. I know that they're always there and that they are essential. I also am fairly sure that no mental process is entirely conscious, entirely explicit, entirely analytical. For example, when you're speaking, when we're speaking, some unconscious process is bringing up the words I need. You know, I said need just now. Why did I say need? I'm not aware of the process that fetched that from memory and I don't even know why it fetched it. It just did, unconsciously. I can conjecture, like, if I don't like the outcome, I can conjecture what the unconscious process might have been, and you know, I might have used a long word and it would sound awkward in a certain context so then I can go back and say, well, a long word sounds pompous, then I'll switch it to a short word like Winston Churchill did.

Mark Alexander  [17:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1020)
And I don't want to be the kind of person who uses long words that are pompous because I don't wanna be pompous.

David Deutsch  [17:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1024)
Exactly, except in certain situations where I do want to be pompous.

Mark Alexander  [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1028)
So,

David Deutsch  [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1030)
You know, I can, you can criticize and criticize if something becomes problematic, you can criticize and solve the problem in principle.

Mark Alexander  [17:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1039)
Got you.

David Deutsch  [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1040)
And the only time that this gets stuck is when there's something irrational underway as I described and that's what I call a hang up.

Mark Alexander  [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1049)
Got you, got you. So what do you find really helps decision-making?

David Deutsch  [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1058)
I try to avoid decision-making. I mean, it depends what you're calling decision-making. I might have a problem and I might be seeking the solution. This doesn't usually look like having an array of solutions. I mean, usually even having one solution is pretty good. The problem is that we have no solutions. But I'm generally speaking, I only have one kind of thing I want. And if I have another one, it's quickly resolved and I don't have to have a policy for how to resolve them. I mean, obviously, problem solving involves at least two things, so I solve problems, but I don't think this comes into decision making much.

Lulie Tanett  [18:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1106)
But somehow it is only one thing at a time and there's never like cross talk or there's never you're never encountering something that makes it feel like there's a trade-off or there's a suffering thing.

David Deutsch  [18:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1120)
So yes, those if you're talking about everyday things then there's really no reason why they should be problematic.

Mark Alexander  [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1129)
And yet?

David Deutsch  [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1133)
The kind of problem I'm working on are problems to do with ideas. So I'm trying to develop Constructor Theory and Constructor Theory has this major flaw or gap that it doesn't deal properly with time in physics and every other almost every other theory in physics has got time deeply built into it. And I think that for many reasons, some of them inexplicit no doubt, but for many explicit reasons, I think that constructed theory is either true or it's definitely the path to the truth. And yet I can't think of a way of incorporating time. I mean actually I'm describing it my state of mind a little earlier some days ago so there I've got rival theories and those trying to change those rival theories produces a whole lot more rival theories and And none of them are satisfactory and I'm thinking of new ones and I'm thinking of new criteria by which to judge them. In fact, one way of looking at constructive theory is that it is a new way of judging theories in physics, which removes these sort of inherent problems in the existing ways.

Mark Alexander  [20:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1206)
So when you were, and I love that you're at a different point in the Constructor Theory arc than you were when you were just describing it. 

Mark Alexander  [20:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1215)
When you were at that point where you were describing it, where you were evaluating all these possibilities. I imagine there are an infinite number of possibilities. How did you, and you know that you have finite time, how did you decide where to put your attention?

David Deutsch  [20:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1229)
Each new possibility was an attempt to solve the problem or problems in the old possibilities. So, you know, now I can't describe it in as much detail as you may want because again that would be, if I could do that in sufficient detail, I could make an AGI to do it. The reason it doesn't explode to infinity is that each of the possibilities is there for a reason. I'm hoping that it will resolve so-and-so and then I can check to see whether it resolves so-and-so or maybe half resolves it or maybe, you know, there are many maybes and each maybe is chosen with a view to it solving the existing problems. This whole process is intensely pleasurable, it's fun, it's... Although I'm beset by problems, that's where I want to be. That's why I don't want to do my tax return. It's so that I can have those problems.

Mark Alexander  [21:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1291)
Wow, so you're following the pleasure.

David Deutsch  [21:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1294)
The fun, yeah. 

Mark Alexander  [21:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1295)
Yeah. So what's the role that fun has in your creative process? Because if I'm following, creativity is necessary in order for this not to just be some game theoretic exploration?

David Deutsch  [21:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1308)
Yes. Yes. So I think that fun, the state of mind that we call fun is intimately connected with creativity. It's un-bulked creativity. That's what fun is, I think. I mean, you know, we can only talk in very hand-waving terms about mental states and mental processes. It's very ill understood in my view.

Lulie Tanett  [22:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1336)
Yeah. This is also why my podcast is called Reason Is Fun. It's the same worldview.

David Deutsch  [22:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1342)
Yeah. Yeah. 

Lulie Tanett  [22:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1350)
I'm so curious to what extent this maps onto your way of thinking about things or The Art of Accomplishment way of thinking about things. And whether there are any disagreements in particular.

Mark Alexander  [22:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1362)
Well, I'm not seeing any yet and of course that's the main thing that I've been looking for. The one that was kind of an interesting one was where David is saying, Oh, well, I don't have dilemmas. I only ever have one want. And that made me think, maybe we're not talking about the same thing, Or maybe this really is David's world and that's just how it is. And for many of the rest of us, it's not that way. Like I encounter a lot of dilemmas or things that feel like dilemmas, places where there's competing wants. And that's where I find that some tools or just to zoom back out and say, oh wait a minute, what is it that I'm not willing to feel here? That tends to be a very fast path back to the creativity for me. But I think we're speaking the same language insofar as the connection of fun and creativity.

David Deutsch  [23:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1415)
I just wanted to insert that having competing wants is not the same thing as being in a hangup. Competing wants, again, it's this thing that the same words can describe two opposite things, can describe two opposite states of mind. Having competing wants in itself is pleasant, it's like it's food for thought. You know, if all life is problem solving and if problems are competing ideas and in particular competing wants, then all life is and should be competing wants. The thing that makes it unpleasant and pathological is when there's a process underway also in one's mind that sabotages conjecture and criticism and tries to not let the mind as a whole make progress.

Lulie Tanett  [24:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1472)
In the emotions view of decision making, Mark, you said that it's a quick path to getting back to the creativity.

Mark Alexander  [24:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1480)
Which reopens the options so that I can get to a good decision quickly.

Lulie Tanett  [24:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1483)
Whereas David's view seems to be something like taking a different perspective or there are tons of different ways to get to that and this is one of the tensions that I have that I'm wondering about. When do I go into whatever emotion it is versus when do I find a different intellectual view or a different perspective or something because okay when when most people go into their heads and try to intellectualize it that takes them further away from the things they want and then somehow in David it doesn't it takes you closer.

Mark Alexander  [25:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1514)
It sounded like you were saying a choice between feeling the emotion versus do I engage creativity or do I feel the emotions and in my experience...

Lulie Tanett  [25:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1526)
It was more like what is the path to re-engaging creativity.

Mark Alexander  [25:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1531)
And for me that path is feeling the emotions. Like one just goes straight to the other. The emotions are the fastest path for me to get back to creativity, which opens up the options, which leads to a cleaner decision.

Lulie Tanett  [25:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1545)
I think David often recommends basically finding the fun or finding the enjoyment as your first step. Like if you're suffering, if you're whatever depressed or whatever, the first thing is feel better.

David Deutsch  [25:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1558)
Absolutely. Because we haven't mentioned yet, because suffering is simply distracting and is therefore another thing that prevents proper thought from happening. So and suffering, especially suffering that can be mechanically lessened, like you know, can be lessened by having a cup of tea or lessened by having going on a run or whatever, if it can be done mechanically that's obviously the first thing to do. Because then you will definitely be in a better place without even having begun solving any problem.

Lulie Tanett  [26:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1599)
If you are Suffering and you want to solve your problem of suffering, but the suffering is preventing you from being creative, what do you do? How do you feel better?

David Deutsch  [26:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1611)
Well, if there's nothing you know of, like a cup of tea or a hug or a run or whatever, that will reduce your suffering, then you can't. You have to do it another way. But if that's available, then I think it has to be the first thing, because unlike everything else in the whole story, it can be done mechanically.

Lulie Tanett  [27:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1635)
So here's where the emotions view comes into it, which is when there is nothing like that, that seems like it can just put you into a better state, according to this emotions view, like, okay, what is the suffering in the first place? I would say that it's some kind of resisting of an experience. And so if you find that place in you that you are resisting, that emotion that you're resisting, and then you embrace it, basically this is why Art of Accomplishment uses it to get to this state of creativity so I don't know if you agree with that or what you think of that whole thing?

David Deutsch  [27:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1677)
I mean, I haven't thought deeply about that kind of thing I suppose that the reason why people don't naturally do this is in cases where the hang-up is causing suffering directly, not just from the fact that is there but is actually hurting you like each way every time you go around the loop, yeah, it goes. You know you are no good or something then you try and get out of it and you go around in a circle And you come back to you're no good again, So the reason people don't want to embrace the process that's doing that is that they fear being poked again. So I don't know. I mean, you know, it's not a good state to be in. 

Mark Alexander  [28:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1725)
I mean, at some point it feels like there's a bifurcation that happens where that loop happens over and over and over and you keep getting poked and it just kind of, wow, life just sucks and sucks more and sucks more and sucks more. And then the bifurcation point can happen where this is untenable, like where you quote unquote hit rock bottom and then you've got the energy to do something big and drastic.

David Deutsch  [29:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1755)
Yeah, I can easily imagine that happening and if it happened it would be a case of explicit theories having changed the environment in which the inexplicit theories are operating and allowed them to evolve. In general, the theories of these different kinds are not conflicting by because they are contradicting each other, as it were. Not usually, anyway. Usually they do it indirectly by changing the environment in which, so in this case the explicit theory, this can't go on, well, you know, this is rock bottom therefore it can't go on, therefore I can't do the usual thing, therefore I must do a different thing. That, if you just said that, it wouldn't make any difference to the situation, but you feel it because the way that your feelings are evolving is affected by you having reached that decision or that theory. I say I switch to theory because I always want to stress that none of these things are sources of knowledge or rather they're not infallible. They're not. None of them are privileged as knowing what the answer if you don't. They could all be mistaken.

Mark Alexander  [30:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1841)
Would you consider emotions as a source of knowledge?

David Deutsch  [30:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1844)
A fallible. 

Mark Alexander  [30:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1848)
A fallible source of knowledge.

David Deutsch  [30:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1849)
A fallible source of knowledge like everything else. The reasoning is also a fallible source of knowledge.

Lulie Tanett  [30:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1857)
I'm still personally curious when to do the going into emotions move versus when to do the David take another perspective, solve the problem mode. I encounter this every day of my life.

Mark Alexander  [31:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1875)
Yeah, it sounds like there's even a decision process happening to determine which of those you take. What's going on when you find yourself in that position?

Lulie Tanett  [31:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ahlsGDoR4KrPi5UZWTQDf?si=7lBWFCIlT4-NZqZ6oQldoQ&t=1890)
Either I'm doing my practicing art of accomplishment thing or I'm having conversation with David and so kind of doing that or let's see if I'm on my own ah I have I seem to have, I don't endorse this, I seem to have a, the idea that something like always go into the emotion thing because that's what I should do.
