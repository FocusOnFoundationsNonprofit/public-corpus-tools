Welcome to the Reason Is Fun podcast. I'm your host, Lulie Tanett, and today I'm having a conversation with David Deutsch about decisions, the role of creativity in decisions, how we need institutions for making decisions, and all sorts of things about decisions, decision-making. Figure out your life! Come on! 2024, it's the new year, let's go! Welcome back to the podcast, I'm Lulie Tanett.

David Deutsch  0:34
I'm David Deutsch.

Lulie Tanett  0:37
And it's been a long hiatus since we recorded. I actually want to understand decision-making, because it seems like this is a topic. So first of all, I don't think you and I have ever had a conversation where we actually talk about decision-making as a thing or the philosophy of decision-making.

David Deutsch  0:56
I think so.

Lulie Tanett  0:57
Yes, like the abstract ideas. And lots of people have very weird ideas about decisions. They think that you have to collect all the data before you make a decision, or that decisions are made from pros and cons lists, or you need to think about something a lot, and then there are tons of hangups that people have around decisions like perfectionism where they have to get all of the different ideas and not make an error when making decisions or that they are overwhelmed by too many decisions. I get that one a lot. Are there any difficulties you have with making decisions?

David Deutsch  1:38
I very rarely make decisions, or at least not... Not in the sense you mean, not in the sense you're talking about. All that framing, everything you just said about decisions seems to me very mechanical. It's not something that a person does. It's like a machine where you're cranking the handle and you're collecting the data. Well, you can collect the data. You could get your dog to collect the data. That's not the human part of decision making. 

Lulie Tanett  2:08
What do you mean you can collect your dog? You can get your dog to collect? 

David Deutsch  2:10
Well, you could get a robot. You could train your dog to go out and collect things. But collecting things is only worthwhile after the creative process. You start with the problem, not with data. You start with some ideas which seem to conflict with each other. 'We're making this product and it's not selling enough. Yet yet, you know, it's fantastic product. I use it every day. So, why aren't we selling lots of them?' So that's a problem. Sometimes that problem, you might think, 'Well, I think that but obviously other people don't, or apparently other people don't so we could ask them.' Your colleague might say, 'It's no good because in regard to this problem, this particular problem, people are going to lie. They're not going to tell you the truth when you ask them, you know, do you want to do so and so, because this is a charged issue. You know, they have all sorts of hangups, like they don't want to get fat, so they don't want to admit that they like that kind of product and so on.' So in that case, just asking them might not do. But you might think of a cunning way of asking them something else, where the answer to your question about why they're not buying your product will come out.

Lulie Tanett  3:33
What's the decision in this case?

David Deutsch  3:35
Decision is well, yes, you have a problem. You don't yet know what the decision is until you have formed the options. So, the decision might be might turn out to be, well, should we advertise more? Should we change the way we advertise?

Lulie Tanett  3:55
When things are going well, do we ever actually do this process that is making a decision or is it more like in retrospect when you encountered option C after thinking only about options A or B then you just naturally went with C because that solves your problem. And then the A and B correspond to two different theories about how to solve your problem that were in conflict. And so you can kind of think of it like a decision like, 'Oh, should I choose A or should I choose B?' But actually, a decision is always actually a problem. And so usually it's always going to be this third answer.

David Deutsch  4:38
Usually yes, I mean human minds are complicated so if you're not sure whether you should have a Big Mac or a Filet-O-Fish and as you walk towards McDonald's you, you're in two minds, and now it could be that when you get there and you see the big illuminated signs with the Big Mac and the Filet-O-Fish, you decide, 'Well, I'm going to have both.' Or you decided, 'Wait a minute, the way I would enjoy the Big Mac is the same as the way I would enjoy a cheeseburger. So what about a cheeseburger and a Filet-O-Fish?' Or, 'How about having the two of them but not finishing either of them, leaving half of either of them?' I could go on forever thinking about possible alternatives. When one doesn't have food hangups, what actually happens both from an external observer's point of view and from your internal observer's point of view is you want to have a nice dinner, this place serves lots of nice dinners, you go in and you choose which one you want. And that's difficult to express as a decision-making process in the conventional way, because all that's happening is that you're having dinner. That's what's really happening.

Lulie Tanett  6:01
So, what's the difference between the word choose and decide?

David Deutsch  6:05
Only that there's a formal theory called decision theory, which involves things like options and weighing and probabilities and so on. And that has got into the general culture, so much so, that people reinterpret ordinary thinking or creative thinking in terms of that. Creative thinking is never correctly represented by that, because decision theory always casts decisions as mechanical processes. You make the list, you put the different utilities on the list, you add them up, you choose between them. There's nothing in there about making a new option or about looking at existing options in a new way. Or now again, I could go on for an infinite time about how one can reinterpret the problem so as to make it easier to solve.

Lulie Tanett  7:05
What do you mean by reinterpret the problem to make it easier to solve? Oh, you mean like the example with the McDonald's? I mean there it seemed less about reinterpreting and more about thinking about different aspects of the problem that you hadn't thought about before. Whereas in my mind reinterpreting means taking a thing and then being like, oh maybe I do want this after all or maybe I don't need this after all.

David Deutsch  7:27
Yeah, I suppose there isn't any terminology that's sufficiently general to talk about thought processes. But I think the important thing is that thought processes in general and choosing between things and living one's life is all about creativity and it comes from problems. As Popper says, 'All life is problem-solving,' and whether you think of it like that or not, that is what is happening when you're thinking.

Lulie Tanett  7:59
So when you said that you don't make decisions or you don't often make decisions, what does that mean?

David Deutsch  8:05
It means that I don't often find myself in a situation where it seems to me that there is option A and option B. And if I adopt option A I'm losing whatever was good about B and vice versa.

Lulie Tanett  8:23
And it's that you don't make trade-offs?

David Deutsch  8:27
Not consciously anyway but I think probably not at all or I try not to. 

Lulie Tanett  8:32
How could that be possible? Surely, surely no option is perfect. Surely, every option has a problem.

David Deutsch  8:39
Well, you know, my standard example about buying an iPhone.

Lulie Tanett  8:42
And surely all theories are imperfect as well. So wouldn't that also apply to you? 

David Deutsch  8:48
You can always reinterpret a thought process as not having been creative.

Lulie Tanett  8:55
Do you want to remind me, because it's been a while since I heard the iPhone example?

David Deutsch  8:59
Right. Well, the decision theory analysis. I go to a shop, or let's say before I go to a shop, I find out that there's a new iPhone available. I go to the shop and I look at the iPhone and I decide to buy it and I hand over the money and I take the iPhone and I walk out of the shop. Now, that's how I would describe the process. But decision theory would try to dissect this process into pieces that are mechanical. So the idea is, first of all, once I've seen the iPhone, I work out how much I value it, how much I would value having it, and also how much I value the you know 400 pounds or whatever it would cost.

Lulie Tanett  9:52
Is the word decide about dicing up into pieces?

David Deutsch  9:57
I doubt it but...

Lulie Tanett  10:01
Doesn't it mean to cut off, I believe like to cut off options?

David Deutsch  10:05
It would be decise if it was that, but decise could easily turn into decide. 

Lulie Tanett  10:11
I'm going to look this up. Right. Alright.

David Deutsch  10:14
So decision theory would say that what I'm doing, whether I know it or not, is I'm evaluating how much I, how much pleasure or satisfaction, whatever...

Lulie Tanett  10:26
Yo! Sorry, I was right. 'To decide, from Latin, decidere, to cut off from, de off ca-sidere or cadere...' I don't know how to pronounce these things.

David Deutsch  10:40
Cadere, yes.

Lulie Tanett  10:41
Cadere to cut.

David Deutsch  10:41
Okay, well, I'm wrong. 

Lulie Tanett  10:43
So it's sort of resolving difficulties at a stroke.

David Deutsch  10:46
I thought that cutting was a sort of 'ciso', c-i-s, rather than c-i-d.

Lulie Tanett  10:56
There's probably multiple words for it. Anyway, yes, you're saying.

David Deutsch  10:59
Yes, so the reinterpretation of my behavior is that I attached, I worked out how much pleasure I would get from the iPhone, how much pleasure I would forego by handing over the 400 pounds. I would have to think of the other things that I could buy with it or the things that I would forego by buying it.

Lulie Tanett  11:22
Sounds exhausting.

David Deutsch  11:24
Yes, and I think it almost never happens except to people who are ideologically committed to thinking that it must go like that. So, and then, when I buy, when I hand over the 400 pounds and take the iPhone, the actual benefit that I got from doing that is the pleasure of the iPhone minus the foregone pleasure of the... 

Lulie Tanett  11:53
Because you've tossed away some utils.

David Deutsch  11:55
Yes, exactly. And for example, if it had been... If those two pleasures had been exactly equal, I would have been indifferent to whether I buy it or not. And then, you know, if they say, 'Okay, make it 399 pounds 99,' I would say, 'Oh, thanks. Good, now I can buy it.' But the amount of pleasure I would get from that would be one penny and that's false. The amount of pleasure I would get from that is, if it made sense, it would be the whole 400 pounds. The money that I've given away was only there in order to get that kind of pleasure. 

Lulie Tanett  12:35
I once was trying to decide an Airbnb and all of the Airbnbs that I could find in Prague seemed to have some sort of problem or something that was, you know, it was either too far away from the venue or it was shared, or it was whatever, or it was too expensive. And the thing that caused me to finally make a decision was that I found one that cost 777 dollars, and I thought, 'You know what, that's a really satisfying number. I will, this is actually the thing that has caused me to make this decision.' And so you might think that the value of money is by the exact amount of money it is and that if you have you know 10 dollars off then you get 10 dollars more pleasure, but that's not true. 

David Deutsch  13:31
That is a good example and it might even have made you think that, 'Well, maybe the landlord there has got a sense of humor or has got an eye for you know wry facts.'

Lulie Tanett  13:36
She did have a sense of humor because she cancelled two hours before I was going to.

David Deutsch  13:42
Right, wrong kind of sense of humor. Yes, anyway, the thing that decision theory is missing there is the creativity that I devoted to this whole process. And that creativity was not a kind of decision-making creativity in the way that's usually imagined. It's more like imagining myself owning the iPhone and imagining myself delaying and buying the next iPhone and thinking that I would like to do the first of those things, not how much would I like to do the first of those things compared with the second, because obviously I'd like to do the first of those things. I mean, obviously I'd prefer it if it was only the iPhone involved. So, this aspect of thinking cannot be mirrored either by decision theory or by any mechanical theory or model or computer program or anything like that because we do not yet know how to make a mechanical thing that has creativity. And by the way, side remark, if we did know, it still wouldn't be good enough because it would be making its own decisions in life, building its own way of interacting with the world.

Lulie Tanett  15:12
It sounds like it's not just about creatively finding the most optimal option though, because in that example you gave, you said, ah, I would like this option. And so it sounds like there's an emotional part of this. So a bit of the context of my question is that I did this 'How to Make Great Decisions' course with Art of Accomplishment and one of their big things was that decision-making is always emotional. Like it's never that we have this list of pros and cons and that we do the right optimal whatever, which is similar to what you're saying, although a bit different. And so I'm kind of curious to explore that. Also, incidentally, Damasio, Antonio Damasio, I believe, who wrote The Feeling of What Happens, he also talks, I think he's a neuroscientist or something, and he also talks about how if the region in your brain gets damaged that governs emotions, that completely destroys your ability to make decisions. So for example, if you're trying to think about where to have lunch, then it can take you an hour to figure out where to have lunch or just how to decide between which color of pen to use, then it can take you 10 minutes to figure that out. So first of all, I guess my question is, do you think that sounds plausible? And then the second one is, how do emotions factor into your view of decision-making, given that it seemed like it was this kind of hidden thing in what you said. 

David Deutsch  16:47
Yeah. So, let me first answer the first thing you said, whether decision-making is always emotional. I think that's the mirror image mistake of thinking that decision-making is always mechanical. Our thoughts, internally, our thoughts aren't divided like that. We have conjectures and we have criticisms, and we have all sorts of information that we can use to check whether our ideas are satisfactory. Problems can arise from the conscious explicit part of our minds and from the emotional parts, and, or from conflicts between those parts. And so can progress. Progress can also come from an interplay between the parts and I suppose usually does. When we're talking about, now to answer the second part, when we're talking about people with brain damage, you're really talking about, unless the brain damage is so severe that they are not capable of creativity anymore, that they're basically apes, then unless we're talking about that, if we're talking about someone who is capable of creativity, then what we're really discussing when we're talking about what people do when they have a certain type of brain damage, is we're talking about how they reinterpret their life and the world as a result of the incapacity or suffering or both.

Lulie Tanett  18:34
How could that, how could they have different specific types of reinterpretation? I'm thinking maybe this is actually a big can of worms, like I get itchy every time you talk about this topic because the way you talk about it, it sounds like, 'Oh, well, we're either intelligent and creative or we're nothing.' But we see with many, many, many examples that you can damage a specific part of the brain or you can have a specific type of thing or there's a specific chemical that does a specific thing fairly reliably. However, this is a conversation about decisions and so I want to make sure that we don't go off onto that rabbit hole. So, maybe I will put a flag, a pin in that one. I did want to say, so you were talking about the, how emotions play into decisions. And you were saying basically that you need both the analyzing stuff and the feeling about stuff. Is that right? 

David Deutsch  19:27
Yes.

Lulie Tanett  19:29
This is super interesting because usually I think of the stuff from 'Art of Accomplishment' as being this emotional development thing. But actually, in this Decisions course that I did last year, there was also a very big emphasis on what they called principles. And so in their conception of principles, a principle is something that makes a decision easier to make or makes it more efficient or more enjoyable. Or like basically it's just sort of, it gives you the, what we would call knowledge to make the decision by. And so in the course, you come up with a list of principles that you have for yourself and then you test them and then you figure out what works well. And I was thinking about this and I was thinking, 'Huh, it's interesting that they have this thing that is apparently not about emotions at all. Like it's about this concrete thing that you believe this idea, how does that fit into all of this?' And then I realized and then I was also thinking about how this might correspond to the kind of Popperian-Deutschian framework, and I realized the thing that they call principles is the same thing as what you and Popper unusually call institutions.

David Deutsch  20:50
But institutions can be changed.

Lulie Tanett  20:53
Indeed, and principles, the whole course of the principles thing is that you're constantly improving them and modifying them. And so it really is like, you start, okay, this is your existing set of principles and then you test them and then you change them and you improve them and as you go through this then it gets easier to make decisions and so it's never that they're this static thing and so I think what it is because okay, so you look like you want to say something. You have a disagreement bubbling up inside. 

David Deutsch  21:23
Well, yes, but I don't know if it's a disagreement with what you said. But it does sound to me like this is making the hierarchical mind mistake, that your subsidiary decisions are made by investigating your deep principles which specify what you really want, and then you bring those up and you use those to decide the less important things. And now you just also said that you can change your principles but you obviously can't change your principles by looking deeply into your principles.

Lulie Tanett  22:00
That's not what I said at all. I said the principles of things you make up, you just, you make it up. You're like, okay, so for example, one of my principles last year was, 'It should be fun.' And the idea of this principle is that if I notice that I'm doing something but it's not fun, or that I'm doing this work and I'm kind of doing this work for some other reason. And so it's a principle that sort of invites me to look like, 'Ah, maybe there is a way to make this more fun or maybe this is actually the wrong thing for me to be doing.' And this was a principle I kind of came up later on in the course, and all of these are just made up. I don't know, I could have a dozen principles, and you do, you brainstorm them. So I don't think they're making the area. It's not about looking deep inside you, it's the opposite almost. It's like the emotion side, that's maybe more about the looking deep inside you, but the principle side is something, it's basically a list of the things, like your best guesses about what your ideas would say if you were, and it's not just what your ideas would say if you were consistent but it's about actually testing and iterating on them until you actually get something that does work for you.

David Deutsch  23:09
I thought that the principles were ultimately about your feelings.

Lulie Tanett  23:17
No, that's the thing, I'm saying it surprised me initially that in 'Art of Accomplishment,' which is often about like, oh, if you just sort out your feelings, feel your feelings, then everything is easier. It has this other component. And so when before you said, 'Oh, well, I think that's going too far. That's the mirror image of trying to analyze everything, is just trying to use your emotions on it, on everything.' Well, actually it's not like they have this other thing, which is the other sort of equally important thing. Now, I think they don't, well, they don't have the same explicit philosophy that we do on that, namely institutions and stuff. But so the reason that I think that it's similar. So, okay, first of all, the way that you use the word institutions is really weird. You use it in situations like a relationship institution is the set of practices and knowledge about how to interact with a given person, like if you have a relationship institution between you and another person. 

David Deutsch  23:18
And expectations. 

Lulie Tanett  23:20
Expectations, yeah. And whereas most people think of institutions like an old building with outdated bookkeeping, I don't know.

David Deutsch  24:29
Right. Well, you know, there's an institution as an old building which Popper would disagree with. So he would say that the institutions are ideas. I'm not sure to the extent to which Popper would use the word institutions or even have the concept institutions for all possible domains of thought, as I would. I would say there are institutions in one's mind and in groups of people's minds that determine for the moment how they will interact, what they will get out of each others' existence and communication and so on. So yes, I use that. I'm not sure that... I don't know whether Popper would use it like that. I don't care, of course.

Lulie Tanett  25:17
So, you specifically use institutions to mean a broad thing of, is it, like, set of existing knowledge and practices and expectations?

David Deutsch  25:28
And yes, especially knowledge and practices and expectations about how other knowledge and practices and expectations will be treated.

Lulie Tanett  25:40
How is this different from rules of thumb?

David Deutsch  25:43
Well, rules of thumb could be anything. You can have a rule of thumb that green means go and red means stop.

Lulie Tanett  25:50
So an institution is something like, you could think of it like a filter. So if you've got some object level thing and you're trying to decide between different object level things, then you might have a more meta level institution for making that decision. And so what's an example of that?

David Deutsch  26:09
Well, so for example, if I'm standing in the bus queue and somebody pushes in front of me, that will invoke or activate certain institutions about how people should behave in bus queues, how if they don't, what they can expect other people to do how, what you can expect the bus driver to do and so on, and it also includes political institutions because you'll be thinking that you're entitled to so-and-so and the other person isn't or is, you know, the other person could be disabled in which case the institutions would say they should go first and so on.

Lulie Tanett  26:52
So is, 'It should be fun,' a bit of institution? 

David Deutsch  26:56
Yes. 

Lulie Tanett  26:57
And what's the institutions that it is part of, it is a bit of? 

David Deutsch  27:03
Well it's...

Lulie Tanett  27:04
So you wouldn't say it's an institution in itself?

David Deutsch  27:06
So, an institution it is... All sorts of theories participate in implementing or judging the principle 'It should be fun.' To call something an institution, and really nothing hangs by what you call it, but I would call something an institution if it's to do with how we judge and expecting. So if you have that principle and you then, or you have that institution, what that means is that you are in the state of mind where if something isn't fun, it'll raise a flag. And someone who doesn't, someone who says, you know, 'What would Jesus do?' or, you know, whatever, simply wouldn't raise a flag. Their flag would be raised by something completely different.

Lulie Tanett  28:02
And I guess this also fits into that when things are going well, you're not making decisions, you just have this creative process that is modified by your ideas about what qualifies as a good idea and what you want and so on. So yeah, I find this really interesting. So on a knowledge or information perspective, If we're thinking like, okay, how do we get the best things possible? How do we get the most knowledge or the best knowledge or the best ideas or the most progress and whatever? And how do you make better or worse decisions? And it sounds like there's two things happening here. One of them is that you have this 'what you want' thingy, which isn't just an algorithmic 'here is all of the information and therefore this is the necessary option that we will choose' because there's a 'well, what do you want in the situation' which might be considered the emotion side of it, question mark?

David Deutsch  29:07
Well, in part, yes.

Lulie Tanett  29:09
And then the other thing is, what are the types of things that lead to you getting what you want, or the good thing happening? Which would be this institution's principles thing?

David Deutsch  29:24
Yes. Again, I have a feeling that's slightly oversimplified, But yes.

Lulie Tanett  29:33
What detail would you add there? 

David Deutsch  29:34
Well, one thing I'd add is that our wants may be contradictory. So, you know, when you ask somebody, 'Do you want another piece of cake?' they might, well, they might express their answer in all sorts of ways which have the wrong epistemology and whatever, but the fact is there's a process running in their mind that does want the cake and there's a process that does not want the cake and they're in conflict and one or other of them will win unless they're losing that part of their brain. They've lost that part of their brain and they just sit there forever not knowing whether they want the cake or not.

Lulie Tanett  30:15
That part of their brain, namely the part that can solve the problem?

David Deutsch  30:19
Well, no, I mean according to this theory that you told me a few minutes ago.

Lulie Tanett  30:26
Well, they just wouldn't have wants in the first place and so it'd be difficult to...

David Deutsch  30:31
Well, they must want to choose, otherwise they'd get up and walk away.

Lulie Tanett  30:36
Huh. Well, I don't claim to know the theory myself.

David Deutsch  30:42
There's something.

Lulie Tanett  30:44
There's something. I haven't quite understood at least.

David Deutsch  30:48
As you said, I would always translate something into...

Lulie Tanett  30:54
But there would be... Maybe it's something like the relative salience of the different wants and so if everything feels about the same then it's difficult to resolve.

David Deutsch  31:09
That's not true. Yeah, if everything feels the same you just take the first one that... 

Lulie Tanett  31:15
Why the first one why not the second one?

David Deutsch  31:16
Well, yeah, or you take the second one... 

Lulie Tanett  31:18
Or walk away or...Yeah, okay, so when your emotions get messed up by brain damage that, I mean, there does seem to be a thing where depressed people have a difficult time doing anything and so they just lie in bed. 

David Deutsch  31:39
It's not because the mental electrical potentials of the different decisions are all equal. It's because something is sabotaging whenever they get close to choosing a thing, something is sabotaging them and saying that that's wrong.

Lulie Tanett  31:57
I'm not sure that these two things conflict. Okay, so maybe what's happening is that somehow it could somehow it causes this sabotaging process to happen more.

David Deutsch  32:13
Yes, but it shouldn't though. That's...

Lulie Tanett  32:16
Double checking or something.

David Deutsch  32:17
That's a hangup.

Lulie Tanett  32:20
I don't know it's fully. Because you can get in the state of mind where you are doubting every, I mean, it could be a hangup or a mistake, but you can get into the state of mind where you become a skeptic about everything. So suddenly you're thinking, 'Oh, why do I think this?' Or, 'Why do I want this?' And, 'Maybe I'm wrong about that. Let me just check.' And then the 'Let me just check,' you know, this is a sort of a thing. It's almost like you have to re-figure out your existing ideas or your why you believe things or something like, I don't know this is kind of running into the justificationist stuff.

David Deutsch  32:58
Yes, and you know it is exactly that, all the authoritarian theory of knowledge. So if your hangups were formed at a time when you were subordinate to authority all the time, and if, having got out of that situation, you're still expecting authority to tell you which is the right answer and not to punish you for choosing the wrong answer, then you may sit there in front of the different coloured candy floss and not know which to take. Because every time you want to take one. But in fact, like I said just now, if you feel overwhelmed by the fact that there are 10 different colors of candy floss and you can't choose which one and you're not walking away, that means you want candy floss and something is sabotaging a very simple mental process which really shouldn't, you know. It's hardly worth being called deciding.

Lulie Tanett  34:04
None of our ideas are true or complete. And so all of our ideas have some kind of problem with them.

David Deutsch  34:12
Well, have some kind of false, falsity with them, but not necessarily a problem.

Lulie Tanett  34:18
Well, if you encounter a falsity, then isn't that a problem?

David Deutsch  34:22
Not unless you have some reason to believe it's false, or reason to think it's false.

Lulie Tanett  34:27
So if you think it's false, then isn't that a problem? If you have a particular reason you think it might be false, then that's a problem.

David Deutsch  34:35
So if you both think it's true and think it's false, that's a problem.

Lulie Tanett  34:41
Right, well, if you don't have a better idea and you've encountered a, you've thought of a criticism of the thing that hasn't been answered. So, okay, one time I was feeling kind of bad and I wanted to do something other than lie on the floor in my living room, but every idea I came up with I thought of some reason that it wasn't worthwhile or it wasn't going to work or whatever and so what was going on there?

David Deutsch  35:12
Well, for some reason you ended up lying on the floor, which might have been the best thing to do, but it or might not, but either way you also had a theory or feeling or impulse to do one of these other things. And every time you thought of doing one of the other things or lying down on the floor, I put those all into the same category, something sort of made you feel bad about that. And for such a simple decision, which again is hardly worth calling a decision, being stuck on it and not being able to resolve that situation can only be a hangup.

Lulie Tanett  36:04
I think what was happening there is that something like, I was being too critical and this, my critical filter was turned up too high such that nothing could get through. And so the solution that I found to it, so first of all I was trying to do some Alexander Technique thing. I thought, 'What if I just, I non-do something.' And I thought, 'Yes, I will non-do something.' And I was thinking about this and then I was like, 'Okay, but meh.' And then I realized, oh, I was sort of trying too hard to do this non-doing thing. Because I thought, 'Ah, well, it doesn't matter what I choose. Like, anything is better than lying on the floor. I'll just choose something.' And then so something came and to my mind and I thought, 'Okay now I will choose this,' I thought to myself. But then the process of criticizing it kind of came in, and so what I did instead was I decided that if the hint of a notion of something comes up, the next time the hint of a notion comes up, then I'm just going to do the thing and I'm not even going to think about it. And that was actually the thing that caused me to get up and do something else. Like I guess I don't fully know what the, what you'd call a hangup, was there. But it seemed like dwelling on things caused me to be unable to decide between them. And I think if you analyze any option, you're going to find problems with it, and so isn't it partly just the case of going with your gut instinct or like how I know, how do you view this whole thing?

David Deutsch  37:43
First of all, I, from what you describe, that is what I would prima facie say is you found a way to sabotage the process that was sabotaging the decision-making. So you decided in advance that when it next comes up, you're going to ignore it. 

Lulie Tanett  38:02
No, no, no, I didn't. What happened was that I had a thing that came before that process could start up. Like I found a way to act before that process.

David Deutsch  38:14
Okay. Well, a bit like, people with migraine, you know, they get, they get an aura or something before the pain starts. And so they know that when they get the aura, you know, whatever, something like that. 

Lulie Tanett  38:28
Not like a migraine, because that is when you get the aura of 'it's going to start up,' but I'm talking about before that happens, I'm going to look at the other thing, namely the 'what would be nice to do' thing before the other process kicks in because before it would be 'What would be nice to do? Oh, maybe I'll go a tea." And then, 'Ah, but I can't get a tea because blah, blah.'

David Deutsch  38:50
Ah, I see. Well then, you, it's not that you interrupted the process. You overrode the trigger that usually starts the process.

Lulie Tanett  38:58
Right. And so what I'm saying is that the trigger that starts the process or maybe the process itself is being overly critical. And I guess the reason why I'm talking about criticism is if we think of knowledge in the Popperian way where everything is either a conjecture or a criticism or actually it's kind of both at the same time, but increasing this critical filter then causes nothing to get through, whereas you want some conjectures to get through. And then I guess my question is what is the thing that causes certain conjectures to get through? I suspect there's something to do with emotions there. What's your view?

David Deutsch  39:33
I don't have a specific view about that in that sense. I think it has to do with emotions and it has to do with thinking and analyzing and so on. They all, __with something that's, like, bothering you, then all different kinds of theories are going to be involved in solving it. I don't think we can know, and if we did know, I don't think it would be helpful to cast it as your emotions did so and so and your analytical part of you did so and so. I don't think it's like that. Sometimes we can dissect with hindsight a piece of thinking in that way but it's always an approximation and as I say it's not very helpful.__

Lulie Tanett  40:23
So, what is actually happening?

David Deutsch  40:26
So just thinking, I mean, there's conjecture and criticism and so there's a problem. But from the way you described it, you were separating that from the other options, because you consider the other options as substantive and the lying on the ground as just a symptom of not being able to decide between the things. And I was assuming that it was the latter, that lying on the ground was a symptom of not being able to decide between the things. And so I want to reject the idea that the reason this was difficult was that they all had equal utility. And I also am suspicious of the theory that it was just being overcritical. I mean, it may, it sounds like it definitely was being overcritical. But that's not the point. The point is that there was a process which was using criticism to specifically prevent you making that decision.

Lulie Tanett  41:26
So, AOA would say that the critical thing would be a way to not feel something rather, and that if I could feel my feelings then the decision would become sort of obvious or second nature. 

David Deutsch  41:48
It could happen. 

Lulie Tanett  41:50
Is there an alternative? Like, what do you think is happening? 

David Deutsch  41:51
Yeah, well, there are lots of things that it could be.

Lulie Tanett  41:53
I mean, on the theory that decision-making requires this emotional component. 

David Deutsch  42:01
Requires? 

Lulie Tanett  42:03
Well, so deciding something is a physical action. And physical actions require, you know, physical processes to happen in the body. Now, this is sort of more my Alexander Technique-inspired take. And so, in order to physically act, things need to happen in the body and I suspect that emotions are for causing particular physical actions to happen in the body. So, fear might be for running away and, you know, when you get scared then these processes happen in your body such that it is easier to move and you get like stronger, or whatever, or faster or more reactive or whatever. Or whatever. Similarly, like, if you're very angry, like lots of people do angry workouts because you get stronger because you're, you know, you're protecting something or you're, you know, whatever, whatever anger is about, like boundaries, whatever, I'm going to fight. And then I could give a similar example for all of the emotions. And so I kind of think that emotions in humans, it's sort of like emotions in animals, if we can call it emotions or feelings or the same kind of chemical processes that we've inherited from our animal ancestors. In animals, they all had a physical action associated, because they would need to, otherwise they would not evolve. And now in humans, not only do we use emotions for this physical moving thing, we also use emotions to think in certain ways or to, I don't know, there's some kind of relationship between emotions and what we think and what our relationships are and so on that is more sophisticated than the equivalent version in animals. And so going back to what happens when decision-making gets stuck, surely it must have some kind of emotional quality because emotions are to do with actions. That's an argument.

David Deutsch  44:11
I don't think emotions can be, I don't think the emotions are necessary for actions, especially not emotions that evolved for the action.

Lulie Tanett  44:22
How can you do an action if you don't want something?

David Deutsch  44:24
So if, well, you might want something, but you might not want the thing that the emotion evolved to make you want.

Lulie Tanett  44:30
Well, no, I'm not talking about whatever the emotion, I mean, I think we're people and we have done something with the emotional process so that it's much more customized.

David Deutsch  44:39
So we can do things without wanting to, you know, we can, once you're a skilled driver, you...

Lulie Tanett  44:46
Isn't it that a different part of you wants that thing? I don't think we can do things without some part of us thinking that this is the best option that we can do, right?

David Deutsch  44:57
Well, that's slicing it up too mechanically. I think an actor can act angry or act frightened in a way that's from the outside indistinguishable from the real thing. And similarly, as I was just saying, if you learn to drive, then after a while you can drive, you can put the clutch down without ever feeling that you want to put the clutch down.

Lulie Tanett  45:28
Well, a subconscious feeling is still a feeling. Like having an intuition for something is still...

David Deutsch  45:34
So, an animal can want to run away but doesn't specifically want to put its paws down on the snow in a certain order because that's an automatic process honed by evolution. But humans can do that, they can just want to walk across room without ever thinking about their pacing, or they can think about their pacing, or they can pace without wanting to.

Lulie Tanett  46:09
Isn't it the case that you don't know what is needed for thinking, so how come you don't think emotions are needed for it? I say strawmanning-ly.

David Deutsch  46:17
Well, I could... I'm not saying I know it isn't true. I'm just saying I don't know it is true. I can think of examples of types of thinking that are apparently not emotional, like automatically driving a car or automatically doing a calculation. So, you may have, you may say you're a physicist and you have a theory and you're doing a calculation to see if it's viable. Then, you might have strong feelings about whether it's viable, you know, you're kind of hoping or fearing but the hope and the fear, first of all, don't affect your actual motion of your hand as you're doing the calculation and secondly, they are not necessary for it.

Lulie Tanett  47:04
They, I think that it... So first of all, I think that it does affect your hand. Second of all, going back to the, you gave an example with acting. I think that act, basically, I think that method acting is how actors act. And the thing is, do they have a layer of something else going on or are they like fully, they have they're fully merged with the role, and so I don't think that it is the case that, no matter what they say incidentally, that professional actors who just act without having the feelings, I'd be very surprised if that were the case, like if you measured them, then it would come back with, yeah, they don't have the feelings. Or I would expect that to impact their acting in some way. And maybe most people don't notice whether the feelings are real and, you know, I know someone who's an expert in circling who can read someone's internal feelings and I asked him, 'Okay, so we're watching this program and do what they are acting as correspond to what the actor is feeling inside.' And so it was interesting because it was the program Shrinking and so there was Harrison Ford who was indeed very consistent with his insides, but then there was another actor who on the inside was basically being more performative according to my circular friend who can read people, that I believe is a real thing. And so, I don't know, I think that maybe people can't tell, most people can't tell, unless you are trained in something like circling or another type of inner work like that. But for the peak of acting, like if you really want to act with your full being, I think you would have to have some amount of those feelings, otherwise it would look, because then you'd be having the feeling of wanting to do something else, namely to perform for example, and then that would come across in some way because there'd be some aspects of your acting in the world as in behaving, moving, that is coming from the wanting to perform rather than the role that you want.

David Deutsch  49:27
So I can imagine, I mean you're just imagining things. I can imagine an actor whose feelings are invested in accurately portraying characters. And it might be that the way that they do this is to have an accurate model in their minds not of the character's feelings but of their behavior. So, you have, you, you closely observe people until you work out, you know, how the facial muscles do so and so. 

Lulie Tanett  50:12
Yeah, I suspect this isn't possible, I wish we had an actor here that we could just ask. 

David Deutsch  50:15
They wouldn't know. 

Lulie Tanett  50:17
Why not?

David Deutsch  50:18
Well, because all that they know is their theory of how they do things.

Lulie Tanett  50:22
Well, yeah, but there might be an actor who studied various different schools and can...

David Deutsch  50:26
Yeah, but even so. I mean, they would have an opinion. It might be valuable, but they don't have an access to the truth.

Lulie Tanett  50:33
Well, I'm not saying I want someone for certain access to the truth. I just want someone who knows what they're talking about instead of us. Talking about the field that we, neither of us know nothing about. 

David Deutsch  50:43
I've seen actors talking about acting and being contemptuous of method acting.

Lulie Tanett  50:53
It could be that method acting in particular is a version of acting, okay, here's my guess, not having read any about any of this, and so these are just my guesses based on what I know from more personal development psychology things, but my guess is that method acting is where you what in internal family systems we'd call merge with the part of you that is doing this acting. Whereas a different type of acting, it might be that you have that part of you but you are whatever observing it or that there is another part of you that you do know how you feel about something but you're just inhabiting this character that feels a different way about that thing. And you can access both of them. And so when people are contemptuous of method acting I think that might well be just correct because it might well be that you are limiting yourself by being merged with one part of you or like this character or something and losing yourself in the process. But it's not because another school of acting is you can learn to control your facial muscles by thinking about the exact face. I would be very, very surprised if there was a single school of acting that was about that, that had anything of value or possibly just that it would exist because based on what I know about Alexander technique, you cannot separate mind and body in that way. The way that you learn to hold yourself in a different way in the Alexander technique is that you do a different thing with your mind and then that has emergent effects that the body kind of responds to that. And so I would have thought the same is true in acting.

David Deutsch  52:39
Well, it could be. I mean, you know, I'm not, as I say, I don't know. I only, like, disagree when you have a theory that the knowledge from these different parts of one's mind is of a different kind. That it doesn't obey Popperian epistemology or it's somehow got supernatural access to things that physics says it doesn't have access to.

Lulie Tanett  53:11
I believe that my theory does neither of these things, although it is possible that it does pose a threat to some bits of Popperian epistemology, depending on whether interactionism is true. And what was the other thing? Representationalism or something. Whatever those David Chapman people talk about, that's a thing I would definitely like to talk about at some point. I think this is actually a good place to wrap up, so thank you for coming on the podcast again and restarting it.

David Deutsch  53:43
Thank you for having me.

Lulie Tanett  53:47
So, fun fact, the reason I have this podcast in the first place is that I did this Art of Accomplishment - How to Make Great Decisions course, and it's coming up in about a week, and you have until January eighth to sign up. And if you use my code, lulie100, you get a discount of $100. So I super recommend this course. It has been very life-changing for me and I hope to see you there because I'm also going to be in this cohort.
