David, the laws of physics seem incredible in that they are perceptible to us, we can manipulate them, we can use them for predictions. What does that begin to tell us in terms of their fundamental nature, and how can we begin to look at the laws of physics and see what the nature of reality is?

David Deutsch  0:23
It's certainly the case, and I think this is now uncontroversial, that if the laws of physics were very slightly different in almost any way, there could be no life in the universe, no complex chemistry, and no thinking people, and therefore no one who knows the laws of nature. So they are somehow almost infinitely special in that they allow themselves to be, as you said, not just known, but also used, and they were used before humans even existed to create life and then for the human species to evolve. Now that has been for several decades an unsolved problem at the foundations of physics. Why that is so. Called the fine-tuning problem. And it began in a serious way. People began to investigate this in the 1970s. The physicist Brandon Carter, who was investigating the evolution of stars, found that if the charge on the electron had been only a few percent different, either larger or smaller, then there would be no complex chemistry and no opportunity for life to evolve. So the standard take on this is that this is evidence that the laws of physics as we see them are not the only ones that are instantiated in physical reality. It's rather like the argument, you know, you win the lottery and you say, why me? And it seems very strange that the lottery should have picked out you. And the solution to that is, you'll realize that that's not such a strange thing if you realize that a million people entered the lottery and one of them had to win.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn  2:23
Or if you hit a golf ball and it lands on a blade of grass, you say, what are the odds that it's on that blade of grass? You know, one in however many blades of grass there are on the field.

David Deutsch  2:34
But the thing that makes the fine-tuning problem more mysterious than just any old random number like a lottery or a blade of grass is that the particular blade of grass that it landed on seems to have a purpose, seems to be tuned, as they call it, for our existence. And this seems to violate one of the first things that was realized at the beginning of modern science, which is that humans are not especially distinguished by the laws of physics as the center of the universe or as the purpose of the universe or anything like that, but that everything about us is explained by laws that don't particularly refer to us.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn  3:17  SKIPQA
The Copernican principle.

David Deutsch  3:18  SKIPQA
Yes, yes, that's right.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn  3:20
So the explanations that have been given are that, and they're radically different, and these are pretty much the only two explanations, is that in one way we have been designed to be special by some creator god that some people would like or some super intelligent species in which we're assimilated, some sort of a creative process, maybe not necessarily a traditional god, some sort of creative process. The other extreme are multiple universes in a cosmological sense, which each one of these multiple universes, an infinite number perhaps, picks out different laws of physics so that in the process of this randomized approach, one or more would give rise to us, and we're in that universe, so it's the only one we're in, so we're asking the question, why are we special?

David Deutsch  4:09   SKIPQA
Yeah.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn  4:09
One of those two. That's what we're given. Do you like either one of those?

David Deutsch  4:13
No. I think both of those are incapable of solving the problem. The first one, the idea that the laws of physics were designed by someone or something, simply raises the question that that thing also has to be fine-tuned. It also has the very properties that we're wondering about the origin of in ourselves. Kicks the problem up a level. Yes, without making it any better. It's okay to kick the problem up a level if you then have an easier problem, but if you have the very same problem, then that's an infinite regress. *In-line Question: Or it might be a harder problem if that's a non-physical thing.* Might even be a harder problem, in which case it's worse than an infinite regress. Now the other idea, which is the one that is greatly favored by cosmologists currently, I'm not entirely sure why, but it has become the prevailing theory in cosmology, is this idea that there's an ensemble, a vast set of different universes. Now the trouble with that, as was pointed out by Richard Feynman many decades ago, is that if the only explanation of why the laws of physics seem to favor us is that if we weren't here we wouldn't be asking, the overwhelming majority of universes in which someone is asking, they are only just asking. That is, the universe is only just good enough. There are many more universes where, for example, this room and its contents have just sprung into existence and will disappear immediately afterwards. A fluctuation. Of just a fluctuation. And this idea that the universe could be just one in an ensemble suffers from the fatal flaw that most such universes that have the property of containing us only just have it and we're about to die because a sphere of heat is coming in at the speed of light and will extinguish us in the next picosecond. So that means that some principle, other than just anthropic self-selection, has to be responsible for the fine-tuning and it can't be design because that just kicks the problem upstairs. *In-line Comment: It sounds like there's no solution because I don't got one. I'm waiting how you can solve this.* I don't pretend to have a solution but I think I have an argument why there can be a solution apart from those two. If the solution isn't either of those two then the solution is a law of physics. It's a law of physics that applies in our universe or perhaps in our universe and a trillion others. But just having, as I said, just having multiple universes doesn't solve the problem. They would have to be multiple universes that are tuned so that most things in them don't just only just exist. I think the key is that the laws of physics as we currently conceive them are based on atoms and working out everything that happens from a microscopic level. But if we admit into fundamental physics laws about emergent properties such as computation, one of those may imply that we exist without being anthropocentric.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn  7:50
David, as we consider the laws of nature, we always try to find those which are the most fundamental and physicists would have us go deeper and deeper in a reductionist sense to try to find those laws. How do you look at even approaching the problem?

David Deutsch  8:11
What I take to be a fundamental law is one that is implicated in many other explanations. And the most fundamental laws in physics happen to be reductionist laws of quantum theory and the theory of relativity. Although there are non-reductionist laws like the second law of thermodynamics, even in physics. But there are other laws. The principle of evolution, for example, which says that adaptive complexity can only arise through variation and selection, is a rigid law of nature and yet is intrinsically emergent. So that's another law. The laws of epistemology that say that knowledge is acquired by conjecture and criticism, that's another rigid law.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn  8:57
So now you've given three radically different kinds of laws from fundamental physics to biology of species to approach to knowledge that you're saying are all fundamental but are radically different even in their categories.

David Deutsch  9:15
Yes, they are all fundamental in that they are needed to explain many things and we can't explain everything in terms of just one of those strands.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn  9:24
And therefore to you, explanation is an organizing principle that can unite those.

David Deutsch  9:31
That's right. And one of the things that looking at it this way helps with is that we can see that laws at different levels of emergence actually mesh together into what I call the fabric of reality, into a sort of unified world view, which we can then extend. One of the things I'm trying to work on now is extending the theory of computation into the theory of not just what can and can't be done with abstract objects, but the theory of what can and can't be done with any objects, which is a way of looking at physics in the manner of the quantum theory of computation. And remarkably, that connects not only physics and computation, but it also has all sorts of philosophical implications such as optimism comes out of that theory.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn  10:26
Well we certainly need some optimism, but I'm at a loss to see how we can get optimism from where we are, so walk me through. What do you call this theory?

David Deutsch  10:36
It's called constructor theory. It's the generalization of the theory of computation to the rest of physics. And the way it's linked to optimism is very simple. If you imagine the set of all transformations, we want to transform the world into a better world, let's say. Now some of those transformations are permitted and some are not permitted by the laws of physics. So the question is, which ones of them can we actually achieve in real life? And the answer to that must be, according to constructor theory, that the ones that we can achieve in real life are precisely the ones that are not forbidden by the laws of physics. So if the laws of physics say we can't travel faster than the speed of light, then we never shall. But if there isn't a law of physics that says you can't live to be 500, then living to be 500 is a soluble problem. It's just a matter of knowing how.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn  11:36
So what are the limitations of physical laws that will give us those ultimate constraints? Because anything within those constraints is ultimately achievable.

David Deutsch  11:47
That's right. So the laws of physics are not actually very onerous in regard to achieving what humans want to achieve. Even traveling to another galaxy, although you can't do it in the time, fortunately the relativity means that your time will slow down if you travel very fast. So if you really wanted to travel to another galaxy in your lifetime and you had the right technology, you could do so subjectively. So it's not very onerous. The things that we are accustomed to calling evils, even the ones that are deemed to be inevitable evils like death, are actually just a matter of technology to solve.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn  12:30
So you look very optimistically in terms of what technology can achieve.

David Deutsch  12:35
Yes. And this, as I said, follows from very fundamental considerations within physics. The thing is, if there were a thing that we can't achieve no matter what knowledge we bring to bear, let's say it was living to 500 or something, there's no law of physics, suppose that there's no law of physics that we can't, but we still couldn't achieve it, well then if we can't achieve that no matter what knowledge we bring to bear, then there is another law of physics that says that we can't do that, and that's a testable law. A testable regularity in nature is a law of physics.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn  13:09  SKIPQA
So as we push forward, as we push knowledge forward, as you would like to say infinitely forward, as we do this... Or unlimited, yes. As we do this, we will either make progress or discover new laws of physics that constrain us, one or the other.

David Deutsch  13:26  SKIPQA
Exactly.
