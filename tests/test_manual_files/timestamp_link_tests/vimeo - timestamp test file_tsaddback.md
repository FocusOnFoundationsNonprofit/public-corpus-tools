All right. Hi there. I'm Randy True with FloodLAMP Biotechnologies, and this is the FloodLAMP testing training program for our QuickColor test. This is a visually read colorimetric LAMP test that can take as little as about 15 minutes of hands-on time to run, and has high sensitivity, molecular quality. This is a great screening test and we're going to be running it here in this setup and the training program is going to cover all the mechanics and the tips and tricks for doing all the steps. We're going to be going through both the steps as well as the run sheets and the way that we log these runs, which are a key part of our quality system. So stay tuned. This is going to be a fun little series here. Thanks.
