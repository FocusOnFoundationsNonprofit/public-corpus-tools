Izzy: Hi Santa! I only want a few things for Christmas. The first thing on my list is a real-life penguin.

Santa: Well, you know penguins need a lot of ice and fish. Are you ready to be a penguin landlord?

Izzy: Yes! I want to be a penguin fairy princess! Can you give me fairy magic too?

Santa: Sure, but remember, with great fairy magic comes great responsibility!

Izzy: Okay I guess I gotta think about that. Can I have a candy store where all the candy is free?

Santa: Of course! But don't forget to brush your teeth after eating all that free candy.

Izzy: Yes, I promise. Oh yeah, I also need a bin to hold all my new candy.

Santa: Hmm, not sure why you need a bin when you got a whole candy store, but sure, I can do a bin. So what's next?

Izzy: Let me see, just an ipad pro. With the pencil and AR headset.

Santa: Uh ... those might be out of stock.

Izzy: Well how about just a credit card then? Oh, and magic to become a fairy.

Santa: Credit card declined. Fairy magic granted.

Izzy: Oh yeah, I want a pink rug in my room instead of a green one, more legos, and to live forever.

Santa: Ha! You can live forever in your memories.

Izzy: Thank you, Santa! One more thing, can I have chickens too?

Santa: Sure, but they might try to eat your free candy, so be careful!

Izzy: I will! Thanks, Santa!

Santa: You're welcome, Izzy! Merry Christmas!
