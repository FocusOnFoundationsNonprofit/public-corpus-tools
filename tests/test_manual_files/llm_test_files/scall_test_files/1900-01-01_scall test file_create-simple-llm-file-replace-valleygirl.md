Like, OMG, can you believe he's like talking about, wanting to know everything in the universe? That's like so intense, but like, totally inspirational! I'm like, kind of jealous of like the ancient scholars who like knew everything back then. But, like, yeah, totally agree that we're like heading towards a time when we can wrap our heads around all the explanations out there. It's like, mind-blowing, right? I am like totally on board with this multiverse thing he's talking about, sounds so rad!

Like oh my god, so like, quantum mechanics theory is like so spot on with its predictions, it's like the best ever! And to like, explain why it's so accurate, we have to think beyond just what we see, you know? It's like, reality is like way more diverse and has all these parallel universes. It's like totally mind-blowing, right?

Like, oh my god, totally! Why would we even need, like, a bunch of different universes, right? I mean, can't we just, like, chill in this one and be, like, totally awesome? Ugh, so confusing!

Like, oh my god, quantum mechanics is, like, totally mind-blowing, right? I mean, have you, like, ever thought about parallel universes before? It's, like, so trippy. Why do we, like, even have to believe in them, right? But, like, this whole experiment with the laser and the holes and interference, it's just, like, so totally rad. I can't even deal!
