But why would we need multiple universes?

Suppose you take one of the classic experiments of quantum mechanics, for instance, the prediction of the interference of light. Now, I can show you interference on a simple laser, which we can. {What is it that forces us to believe in parallel universes?} **Possible Speaker Transition Error** I'll show you the experiment. This is an experiment, a very old one, that's been, was first done hundreds of years ago, long before quantum theory was even thought of. It involves shining light through holes. This is just a piece of cardboard with little pinprick holes in it. And there's one of them, just a single hole.
