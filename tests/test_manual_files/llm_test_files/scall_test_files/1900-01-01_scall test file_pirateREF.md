When I was a child, I remember being told that in the distant past, a very learned person might hope to understand everything that was understood. Whereas now because of specialization, because so much is known, that's impossible that one person can only understand a very small fraction of what's known. And I really didn't believe this, I didn't want to believe this. And I envied the ancient scholars who might have aspired to knowing everything that was known at the time. And what I meant by knowing everything that was known for understanding everything that was understood, is not that they knew in detail everything that happened, that they had lists of things which they remembered. But that's very far from what I meant. I meant that they understood all the explanations that were known. And I believe that we are not heading away from an era in which one might understand all the explanations as they're known, but towards it, because we are continually unifying and broadening and deepening our explanations of the world. The universe that we see around us is real. But it's only one small facet of reality. The whole of reality consists of many such universes, and they're all equally real. And we call the whole set the multiverse.
Ahoy matey! Listen well, David Deutsch be spinnin' yarns 'bout the vast sea of knowledge, how in the ol' days a scholar might navigate the entirety of knowin' like a captain knows his ship from bow to stern. But now, arrr, the waters be too wide, too deep, for any single soul to chart. Yet, Deutsch be not losin' hope, no sir. He dreams of sailin' towards a horizon where the explanations of the world, they be like stars guidin' us to understandin' the whole cosmic ocean, includin' the mysterious multiverse. Aye, 'tis a bold voyage he envisions, where the maps of knowledge be ever expandin', and we pirates of intellect chase after the treasure of understandin' everythin' that be understood, beneath the boundless skies of reality. So, raise the sails, me hearties, for this be a quest not just for gold or jewels, but for the grandest loot of all - the secrets of the universe itself!

The multiverse theory comes about as an explanation of the predictions of our best theory of physics, which is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics makes very accurate predictions, the most accurate predictions that any theory of physics has ever made. But if you want to explain why these predictions are so, how these physical events come about, there's no alternative but to postulate that what we see around us is not the whole of reality, that reality is much more varied and has a great multiplicity. This is what we call multiple universes.
Arr matey, what this landlubber Deutsch be yarnin' 'bout, with his talk o' multiverse theories and quantum mechanics, be nothin' short o' navigatin' the uncharted waters of the cosmos itself! Aye, he claims our reality be but a single ship in a vast armada, each sailin' its own course through the endless sea of existence. It's like sayin' there be countless treasures hidden beyond the horizon, each island brimmin' with its own mysterious booty. Quantum mechanics, he says, be the map that marks the spot, the most precise treasure map we scallywags have ever laid our eyes upon. But to truly understand the riches it promises, we must accept that the world we see is not the whole of the ocean, but merely a single cove in a boundless archipelago. Shiver me timbers, that's a tale grand enough to quench the thirst of any adventurer lookin' to explore the mysteries of the universe!

But why would we need multiple universes?
Arr matey, ye be wonderin' why the vast sea of stars might harbour more than one universe, aye? Well, let me tell ye, in the same way we pirates crave uncharted territories and hidden treasures beyond the horizon, so do the scholars and star-gazers seek out multiple universes for untold mysteries and riches of knowledge. 'Tis the adventure, the quest for the unknown, that drives us! So, hoist the sails and set course, for there be endless possibilities awaitin' in the cosmos, just as there be endless seas to explore. Yarrr!

Suppose you take one of the classic experiments of quantum mechanics, for instance, the prediction of the interference of light. Now, I can show you interference on a simple laser, which we can. What is it that forces us to believe in parallel universes? I'll show you the experiment. This is an experiment, a very old one, that's been, was first done hundreds of years ago, long before quantum theory was even thought of. It involves shining light through holes. This is just a piece of cardboard with little pinprick holes in it. And there's one of them, just a single hole.
Arr matey, gather 'round and lend yer ear to a tale most curious, 'bout the mysterious ways of light, as revealed by the wise seadog David Deutsch. Ye see, me hearties, when we set sail through the vast ocean of knowledge, we be confronted by phenomena that boggles the mind, much like the churning seas in a mighty storm. Deutsch, that clever navigator of the quantum realm, he speaks of an experiment older than the Jolly Roger itself, where light, as elusive as a siren's call, be shone through tiny holes in a piece of cardboard, no larger than the eye patch on me face.

Now, why does this conjure thoughts of parallel universes, ye might ask? As sure as the compass points north, this experiment, simple as it may seem, reveals the light dancing in ways that confounds the old sea dogs and the greenhorns alike. For if ye shine light through but a single hole, it behaves not as a cannonball, straight and true, but as if it were navigating the waves, creating patterns of interference, as mysterious as the Bermuda Triangle itself.

And so, me hearty, Deutsch dares to ask what causes this bewitchment, leading us bold explorers to the notion of parallel universes, as vast and mysterious as the uncharted waters of the Seven Seas. It be a notion as profound as the Kraken's grasp, pulling us into the depths of understanding the very fabric of reality. So hoist the main sail, me crew, as we set course for the unknown, guided by the stars of quantum mechanics and the adventurous spirit of those who seeks to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos. Arr!
