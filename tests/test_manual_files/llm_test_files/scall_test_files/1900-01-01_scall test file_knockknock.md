Here's a knock knock joke inspired by the given text:

Knock, knock.
Who’s there?
Deutsch.
Deutsch who?
Deutsch the philosopher thought he could understand all, but I guess that's quite a multiverse-tial task!

Note: The joke plays on the name "Deutsch" (sounding like 'do such') and his concept about understanding and the multiverse, creating a pun with the word 'multiversal' into 'multiverse-tial', implying that comprehending everything is a task of multiverse proportions.

Knock knock!

Who's there?

David Deutsch.

David Deutsch who?

David Deutsch explaining how in every knock, there's a universe where the door's answered, and one where it's not — welcome to the multiverse of knock knock jokes!

Knock knock!

Who’s there?

Great multiplicity.

Great multiplicity who?

Great multiplicity of universes, because one universe just responded to my knock-knock joke, but I bet there's another where you just ignored the door!
---
Knock, knock.

Who’s there?

Multi.

Multi who?

Multi-verses are quite the puzzle, don't you think? Just like the interference of light through a single hole leads us to question our reality... Can I come in and show you the experiment with cardboard and lasers? It's sure to shed some light—through pinprick holes—on the subject!
