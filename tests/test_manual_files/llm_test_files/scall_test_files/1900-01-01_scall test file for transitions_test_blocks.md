TARGET SEGMENT TO ANALYZE FOR TRANSITIONS

When I was a child, I remember being told that in the distant past, a very learned person might hope to understand everything that was understood. Whereas now because of specialization, because so much is known, that's impossible that one person can only understand a very small fraction of what's known. And I really didn't believe this, I didn't want to believe this. And I envied the ancient scholars who might have aspired to knowing everything that was known at the time. And what I meant by knowing everything that was known for understanding everything that was understood, is not that they knew in detail everything that happened, that they had lists of things which they remembered. But that's very far from what I meant. I meant that they understood all the explanations that were known. And I believe that we are not heading away from an era in which one might understand all the explanations as they're known, but towards it, because we are continually unifying and broadening and deepening our explanations of the world. The universe that we see around us is real. But it's only one small facet of reality. The whole of reality consists of many such universes, and they're all equally real. And we call the whole set the multiverse.

The multiverse theory comes about as an explanation of the predictions of our best theory of physics, which is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics makes very accurate predictions, the most accurate predictions that any theory of physics has ever made. But if you want to explain why these predictions are so, how these physical events come about, there's no alternative but to postulate that what we see around us is not the whole of reality, that reality is much more varied and has a great multiplicity. This is what we call multiple universes. But why

Suppose you take one of the classic experiments of quantum mechanics, for instance, the prediction of the interference of light. Now, I can show you interference on a simple laser, which we can. What is it that forces us to believe in parallel universes? I'll show you the experiment. This is an experiment, a very old one, that's been, was first done hundreds of years ago, long before quantum theory was even thought of. It involves shining light through holes. This is just a piece of cardboard with little pinprick holes in it. And there's one of them, just a single hole.
