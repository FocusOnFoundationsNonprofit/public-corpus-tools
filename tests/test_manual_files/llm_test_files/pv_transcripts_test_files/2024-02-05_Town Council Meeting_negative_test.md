And so to that point, obviously the commission makes a lot of controversial decisions that also draw a big portion of

Ed McGavin (Candidate) [22:52](https://youtu.be/idjDiBy3pII?feature=shared&t=1372)
our community to the meetings. Well, I'd see it seems to be that there's more would draw a bigger portion of our community to the PV forum and things like that, and the meetings themselves, but...

Sarah Wernikoff (Mayor) [23:02](https://youtu.be/idjDiBy3pII?feature=shared&t=1382)
That's can be true, yes. And so along those lines, are you comfortable with making decisions and with these public audiences that may be deemed unfavorable by some, and perhaps even at odds with your own personal preferences? Yes, at this point in my life

Ed McGavin (Candidate)  [23:20](https://youtu.be/idjDiBy3pII?feature=shared&t=1400)
I am, so both professionally and, you know, I've, you know, I think I, just as I said, I was at Amazon for 10 years, I made a lot of unpopular decisions and, you know, it wasn't, I ran all the delivery services up and down the peninsula for five of those years. And there were a lot of times I was not popular with the people who worked for me, as well as local communities where we built delivery stations and that kind of thing. And so, yeah, as I would, I understand the, I'd say the visibility of the role, I understand the time zone popularity of the role. But the other thing is I go back to my first comment in terms of somebody has to do it, and it has to be done, and the alternative is, I mean, you know, just put it away. You know, we're all adults, you know, we just, there's times where we just, you know, have to work through these things. So I'm comfortable with it, I understand it. It's not fun, but on the other hand, you know, like, I'm going to go back to, I thought the planning commission over the last couple of years, I mean, to be blunt, they've done the hard part now that it's approved those, I mean, but that was not an easy process and so I have a Great deal of admiration for what they've been through for the last couple of years. So...

Thank you. What strategies would you use to build consensus among members of the

Ed McGavin (Candidate)  [24:59](https://youtu.be/idjDiBy3pII?feature=shared&t=1499)
planning commission. That's an interesting question, because at least in terms of building consensus, a lot of that is very, as I would say, it all depends upon what, who's on the commission and what it is that they're, you know, what, why they're on the commission, what the issue before them was said to be, other side of it is that it's clear and from falling through in terms of, you know, reading what people have said about the decision, to read most recent decision that they made. I don't think there was consensus, right.
