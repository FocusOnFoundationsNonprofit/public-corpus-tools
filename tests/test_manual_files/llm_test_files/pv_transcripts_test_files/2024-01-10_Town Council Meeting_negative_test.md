Jeff Aalfs (Councilmember)  [31:25](https://youtu.be/R4e6-dcNXEw?si=G_vadcuLPiynOuXF&t=1885)
Yeah, I just want to say, I first worked with Carol in probably 2009, when we, before I was a Councilmember, even before I was an ASCC member and on our project, and I agree she was professional. She was thorough. She was exacting but also patient. And Carol we've really appreciated all the work you've done, and I've worked with you now for 15 years between ASCC and council. Thank you and congratulations. We look forward to seeing more of you. Thank you.

Judith Hasko (Vice Mayor)  [32:01](https://youtu.be/R4e6-dcNXEw?si=G_vadcuLPiynOuXF&t=1921)
So I think it's important to take a moment and really think about what that means 25 years for the town. And what makes our town special is that we have people who just go about their business, appreciating what they're doing for the town fits into the big picture. And Carol's always seemed to come over as professional, but very efficient. And my one time working with her on a planning matter, very seamless. And it goes by so quickly, you almost don't have the chance to thank her. And I think it's really great to see her being thanked in this way after such a long period of time. So thank you, Carol. We really appreciate you.

Mary Hufty (Councilmember)  [32:47](https://youtu.be/R4e6-dcNXEw?si=G_vadcuLPiynOuXF&t=1967)
I'm just going to ditto and say thank you, Carol. You know how much I appreciate all the work we've done together over

Sarah Wernikoff (Mayor)  [32:57](https://youtu.be/R4e6-dcNXEw?si=G_vadcuLPiynOuXF&t=1977)
the last 25 years. The one additional thing I'll add kind of to bookend it is, one thing it seems like a lot of us have in common is Carol is one of the first people you meet in town when you come here and you're working on your building and for your home, whether it's something small or something large and I have same shared experience with Carol as well when we first moved here about 17 years ago. And so it seems like whether you're working with her as a community member or a Councilmember or a colleague on the staff, we've all had such positive experiences and that says quite a lot to do that over as we've said a quarter century essentially. So congratulations Carol. And with that I will move on and I apologize. Sharif, thank you.
