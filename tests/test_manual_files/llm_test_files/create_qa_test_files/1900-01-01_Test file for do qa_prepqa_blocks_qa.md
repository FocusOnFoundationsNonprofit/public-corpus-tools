QUESTION: Why do scientists support the multiverse quantum theory?
TIMESTAMP: [4:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDZ454K_lBY&t=252)
ANSWER: The multiverse theory comes about as an explanation of the predictions of our best theory of physics, which is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics makes very accurate predictions, the most accurate predictions that any theory of physics has ever made. But if you want to explain why these predictions are so, how these physical events come about, there's no alternative but to postulate that what we see around us is not the whole of reality, that reality is much more varied and has a great multiplicity. This is what we call multiple universes.

QUESTION: Why do people believe in the existence of parallel universes?
TIMESTAMP: [4:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDZ454K_lBY&t=293)
ANSWER: Suppose you take one of the classic experiments of quantum mechanics, for instance, the prediction of the interference of light. Now, I can show you interference on a simple laser, which we can. What is it that forces us to believe in parallel universes? I'll show you the experiment. This is an experiment, a very old one, that's been, was first done hundreds of years ago, long before quantum theory was even thought of. It involves shining light through holes. This is just a piece of cardboard with little pinprick holes in it. And there's one of them, just a single hole.
