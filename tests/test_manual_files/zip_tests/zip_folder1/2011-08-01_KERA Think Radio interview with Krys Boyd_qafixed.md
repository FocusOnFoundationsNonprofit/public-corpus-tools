QUESTION: What are misconceptions about what makes science successful?
TIMESTAMP: [1:18](NO LINK&t=78)
ANSWER: One of the most noticeable changes that happened in the history of our species was the scientific revolution, which made the difference between making progress that was either absent or so slow that no human ever noticed it in their lifetime, and what has happened since then, which is that we've got used to change happening all the time and being just part of our lives. And because that change was so noticeable, people wondered what caused it, and initially they got all sorts of wrong theories about what it was that made science successful, and some truth as well. For example, it was realized almost immediately that rejecting authority was a necessary condition for making progress, authority in regard to knowledge, though this spread to political authority as well. But then, in the positive sense, what actually caused science people got really confused and thought that we kind of absorb knowledge of nature by being open to experience, and that experience somehow implanted true ideas about the world in our minds. Now, this is completely untrue, and what I do in the book, one of the things I do in the book is trace how wrong that is, and also how the right, the real, explanation, which is that we seek hard-to-vary explanations, applies not only in science, but in all sorts of other fields, including art and morality and political philosophy and so on.

QUESTION: Is the pre-Enlightenment view that everything worth knowing is already known implausible today?
TIMESTAMP: [3:25](NO LINK&t=205)
ANSWER: _Regarding the pre-Enlightenment view that everything worth knowing is already known,_ it's basically very implausible today, because we're all hoping and expecting that improvements will be made, and the whole of politics is about who has the best idea for improvements and so on. But if you try to imagine, it's difficult to imagine, try to imagine what it was like during most of human history, when nobody ever experienced an improvement in anything. Then, it was, in regard to knowledge, it was sort of common sense that there was this thing called knowledge, we knew that the sun would rise every day and so on, but there was nothing new to discover, because all that was going to happen tomorrow was that the sun would rise again, just like it did today.

QUESTION: What is the relationship between curiosity and intelligence?
TIMESTAMP: [4:16](NO LINK&t=256)
ANSWER: _Regarding the relationship between curiosity and intelligence,_ __curiosity, I think, is a way of referring to the desire for good explanations. It's a way of thinking that there's something here that we don't know, or some problem, some puzzle, and we would like to have the explanation. That is, a statement about reality, which explains why the thing we are curious about is as it is.__ __Intelligence, well, I shy away from that word, because it's laden with this wrong idea of where knowledge comes from. It's a sort of, the idea of intelligence is that we know that there is some ability that allows us to get good knowledge, if only we have that ability. But in fact, knowledge comes from criticism, it comes from conjecture about what might be better than the ideas we have, and conjecture is fallible. So, curiosity is great, intelligence, I think, is a misleading term, and I'd rather refer to things like criticism and creativity.__

QUESTION: Is success in intellectual pursuits due to innate ability?
TIMESTAMP: [5:51](NO LINK&t=351)
ANSWER: __I do think that it's a disservice to humankind, if you like, to promote the view that success in anything, in anything intellectual, that is, is due to something innate. It's not due to innate and innate ability, because there is no such ability possible.__ It is only due to a critical attitude, an open attitude, a desire for truth, that sort of thing. And abilities are knowledge themselves. They are things that we learn in the course of trying to discover the truth and so forth.

QUESTION: Can knowledge grow and achieve objective progress in fields other than science?
TIMESTAMP: [6:42](NO LINK&t=402)
ANSWER: This is part of the question of whether this spectacular growth of knowledge that has happened in science can happen in other fields as well, and the one you're asking about is morality. And I think that the answer must be yes. __There is such a thing as an objective difference between right and wrong. And although it's easy to be cynical and look around at all the evils there are in the world, and also at all the disagreements about right and wrong that there are in the world, I think if you look more deeply and over a longer time scale, you can easily see that there is progress and that it's not just a matter of cultural prejudice or just a matter of definition.__ For example, there was a time only a few hundred years ago when every reasonable person would have thought that slavery is a natural state of some people and that there's nothing inherently wrong with it. Whereas now, you will hardly find any thinking person who doesn't agree that it is a great evil and that steps could and should be made to abolish it.

QUESTION: How have human knowledge and intervention shaped the landscape of our planet?
TIMESTAMP: [8:12](NO LINK&t=492)
ANSWER: A city is the obvious example of what I think is a general truth. Remember, we're only at the Beginning of Infinity, and always will be, and on Earth we're only at the beginning of shaping it. But a city is an example of the fact that once knowledge is involved in physical processes, it is the determining factor of the landscape. That is, whereas other species, the ones that are incapable of generating knowledge, are shaped by and adapted to their landscape, humans create their own landscape and shape it and adapt it. So for humans, there is no such thing as a resource until some human has developed the knowledge for making it a resource. And I think that if we choose to do the right thing and continue to produce knowledge and to seek better things and progress, that this will extend to anything and everything. We will move off the planet and improve things as we go. And no doubt many people will be thinking as I say this, "But cities and other things that we've done haven't always improved things. There's pollution and so on." But I think this is a myth of a rosy past. __It's no good having thinking of a rosy past in which the rivers were clean and the air was pure if people at that time actually were plagued by cholera.__

QUESTION: What is a deeper optimistic perspective on the challenge of climate change and global warming?
TIMESTAMP: [10:14](NO LINK&t=614)
ANSWER: Global warming is one of the first challenges that face us, global challenges, as a result of technology really, or improving things. So we've improved a whole lot of things, but as a result, a slow worsening has happened in part of our environment. Now this has happened on a smaller scale thousands of times. I'm old enough to remember when many of the cities in England had smog and the London fog was deemed to be part of the London scene. It wasn't even thought of as a thing that humans could undo. And yet as technology improved, wealth increased, and standards increased, so the London fog became a thing of the past. And just as the London fog can become a thing of the past, so can the problems of global warming.

QUESTION: Why does the standard view of sustainability contradict a deeper understanding of progress?
TIMESTAMP: [11:33](NO LINK&t=693)
ANSWER: __The idea of sustainability I think is a terrible mistake. It is a hyper-optimistic view, ironically, of what humans are and what humans can do. The idea is that we can find a way of life which will not be dangerous and will not be threatening and will not require any further creativity or progress in order to solve it.__ Now I take the opposite view to that. I think that problems are inevitable and that any kind of stasis is bound to end in catastrophe. So __the only thing that's sustainable is actual progress.__ And what we need to do in regard to global warming, and even more in regard to the things that are coming up that we don't yet know about, which might be far more dangerous for all we know, is to build up knowledge, scientific knowledge and also technological knowledge and also wealth, to be able to deal with unforeseen problems when we discover them, and alas, also, to recover from disasters that we fail to foresee.

QUESTION: What would happen to the human species if we were unable to create new knowledge?
TIMESTAMP: [13:02](NO LINK&t=782)
ANSWER: Well, it's more than _just easier to innovate technologically than change human nature_. If we somehow could succeed in changing the nature of human beings so that they were not capable of creating new knowledge, then the same thing would happen to our species as happened to 99.9% of all species that have ever existed. Namely, we would go extinct. In fact, we would go extinct much faster because our ecological niche depends on creating new knowledge. All our sister species, our cousin species, whatever you want to call them, went extinct. And they went extinct not because they created too much knowledge and fell foul of the unintended consequences of their knowledge, but they went extinct precisely because they lived the sustainable lifestyle to which evolution had adapted them. And evolution played the same nasty trick on them as it usually plays on species, it wiped them out for doing so.

QUESTION: Is it possible for humans to achieve immortality?
TIMESTAMP: [15:18](NO LINK&t=918)
ANSWER: _Regarding if it is reasonable to imagine we could someday make ourselves immortal,_ oh yes. It's obvious that the things that make humans die, I'm talking about natural causes as opposed to accidents and wars and so on, are all just technological matters and we have already solved them. We've increased human lifespan from its natural level of 20 something up to 80 something or whatever it is now. And we know that death is caused by certain organic processes in the body which in principle can be engineered away. So I talk in the book about things like travel into intergalactic space which will no doubt not happen for thousands of years yet, but it would be very surprising if death in that sense were not conquered in the next few centuries. *IN-LINE: ideas already have the potential to outlast the brains and bodies that conceive them. Do we need human bodies to be fully human or would preservation of the contents of our brains be close enough?* There are several different strands of technology that might eventually lead to the effective end of individual people's deaths, such as uploading minds into computers and so on. I don't know which of those will come first. They're all of similar level of technological difficulty, so the chances are that pretty soon after one of them is invented, they will all be invented and we will think it just as ridiculous not to back up our minds onto some backup medium as we do today not to back up our life's work from a computer. *IN-LINE: What an interesting series of challenges we would have then deciding who deserves to be backed up because surely there would be a financial cost to this.* Well there will no doubt be a transitional period during which the technology will be too expensive to apply to everybody. That is already the case. After all, there are medical treatments now that can save some people's lives but cannot save the lives of everybody with that disease. So we have institutions in place that can take care of that situation. But it will only be temporary because one of the things that I elaborate in some detail in my book is that the progress always consists of alternating phases. First a creative phase which solves the fundamental problems and then what Thomas Edison called the perspiration phase where we optimize things. And the thing about the perspiration phase is that it can be always can be automated. And once something is automated, its cost goes down to zero because the only thing that ultimately costs anything is human attention and creativity. So soon after the technology is available, it will become cheaper and eventually will become just as much taken for granted as a supply of fresh drinking water.

QUESTION: What is the difference between rational and anti-rational memes?
TIMESTAMP: [18:53](NO LINK&t=1133)
ANSWER: The theory of memes which was first thought of by Richard Dawkins and then elaborated by Susan Blackmore and many others. I think it's fundamentally true but what I say in the book is that __all the existing treatments of memes miss the most important thing about them which is this distinction that you just mentioned between what I call rational and anti-rational memes.__ The rational memes you characterized just about correctly that they are the memes that are transmitted from person to person because the recipient finds that having that knowledge or that behavior benefits them. But then the anti-rational memes, it's not that they remove interest, it's that they disable people from criticizing them. So there are ideas that disable criticism of themselves. And of course Richard Dawkins" favorite example of this are certain religions. I don't think it's at all true of all religions but still, the archetypal example that he cites is once you start believing that there's a God who will punish you if you stop believing in him, then thoughts about that get suppressed in your mind, and therefore that meme gets hard to abandon. But __I think that this kind of meme which has an overt content of saying, "Don't stop believing in me," is actually a rare kind and the more insidious kinds are the ones that we don't really know why we're doing them. Such as, well you mentioned immortality a while ago. I think that there is an irrational meme that makes people suspicious of the idea of immortality. They don't mind lengthening lifespan but once you talk about lengthening lifespan without any limit they start imagining purely imaginary objections to this. And I don't think that is rational.__ *IN-LINE: It is funny that we have many, many religious traditions that look forward to an afterlife but it's something completely separate and apart from what we have here. But if you look even at literature, the stories of human beings who somehow become immortal they're always miserable and desperate to end this thing.* Yes, this is an example of the irrationality I was speaking of and it is very ironic about religions. That religions too take this view, it's somehow perhaps they think that having real immortality would cheat people of the imaginary immortality that religions offer or something like that. It's by the way also interesting that the first mathematical theories of infinity, and I talk about those too in the book, were bitterly opposed by the church and religious people on the grounds that it was inherently wrong for humans to try to usurp the functionality of God in trying to understand the infinite.

QUESTION: Why is the idea that human resources are finite a mistake?
TIMESTAMP: [23:01](NO LINK&t=1381)
ANSWER: Yes. The idea that the resources of the earth, the resources available to humans, are finite is a mistake. First of all, it's only knowledge that converts something into a resource in the first place. Nobody knew that pitchblende uranium ore was a resource until Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity and so on. And soon we will be mining the asteroids for minerals that are extremely rare on earth. The universe is, to all intents and purposes, unlimited and it is our home. And to regard just the resources that you know about today as being the resources will always lead you into the error of thinking that they are finite and then once we have used them up, what will we do then? Unfortunately, we have no choice because even if we remained at a present level of technology and sustained it forever, all that would do is postpone our extinction. If we want to avoid our extinction, there is nothing sustainable except the growth of knowledge. *IN-LINE: You're not arguing, of course, that we should wantonly go out and waste physical resources. That's not the point that you're making.* No, that's not the point. The question is whether there is an inherent limit on our progress or not.

QUESTION: Why is the view that free will as an illusion incorrect?
TIMESTAMP: [24:47](NO LINK&t=1487)
ANSWER: _Regarding the view that free will is an illusion,_ this is __the idea that because we are made of atoms and atoms are subject to laws of motion that don't allow any wiggle room, therefore everything we do also doesn't allow any wiggle room and therefore our free will must be an illusion. Now, I think that's called reductionism and it is simply a mistake. It's sort of assuming that the laws of physics are a kind of a person, they're a kind of a supernatural being that makes us do things. But it's not true. The laws of physics are simply a description of what we do.__ So it's not the laws of physics that make atoms move around. The laws of physics are simply a description of what they do. And the thing that we see about the world is that there are levels of description. There are descriptions at the atomic level and descriptions at the molecular level and the biological level. And then there are descriptions and explanations at the level of human thought. And there's no reason to expect that just because there's a low level description there isn't also a high level explanation and description. And in the book I give some arguments both due to me and due to people like Douglas Hofstadter that __the high level description is sometimes the only reasonable explanation of what is happening. So for example, if you play a game of chess against a computer, then it's not the silicon that has beaten you, it's the program. The program in the computer. And that program is an abstraction. The program doesn't consist of atoms. The program is an abstraction over the atoms just like human thought is an abstraction over our atoms. And it is the program that has beaten you and when I make a decision, it's I who have made it, not my atoms and not the laws of physics.__

QUESTION: Will we have many opportunities to go extinct regardless of how creative we are?
TIMESTAMP: [27:58](NO LINK&t=1678)
ANSWER: _Regarding the view that, "We will have many opportunities to go extinct regardless of how creative we are',_ I agree with everything in that except for the "regardless." The thing is that in all those cases there is a way that we could make the wrong decisions and be wiped out as a result, including refusing to make decisions or shutting our eyes to problems and so on. But there is also a thing we could do to prevent that. And in all those cases, I mean I've forgotten what they all were now, but I was noting as you read them out that in every case sufficient knowledge would solve that problem. *IN-LINE: So if we were at a place where we could handle it, then we could handle it.* Yes, and of course there is the possibility that it would happen before we have that knowledge. And the lesson of that fact, for example an asteroid strike by something going too fast and too big for us to stop it right now, the lesson of that is that not only do we need to make progress, we need to make rapid progress or we will be wiped out.

QUESTION: Will knowledge continue to grow even if our brains and bodies don't evolve for survival?
TIMESTAMP: [29:21](NO LINK&t=1761)
ANSWER: _Regarding if knowledge will continue to grow if our brains and bodies don't evolve for survival,_ yes, __we have become universal explanation machines, universal computers, universal explanation machines. And that means that the limits of our ability are fixed only by the laws of physics and not by our own constitution.__ For example, again I give this example in the book, humans without technology couldn't possibly live in Oxford where I live because the winters in Oxford would kill any human that wasn't protected by technology such as clothes and weapons to hunt with and so on. And even in the Great Rift Valley in Africa where our species evolved, by the time we had evolved we were already absolutely dependent on technology to survive. Technology like fire and clothing. And so we are not dependent on our physical constitution because we can always adapt nature by using knowledge to compensate for any physical defects that we have or as we like to think of it, any physical defects that our environment may have.

QUESTION: Will immortality include infinite youth or just a prolonged life?

QUESTION: What are two different meanings for the idea that humans are perfectible?
TIMESTAMP: [33:32](NO LINK&t=2012)
ANSWER: _Regarding the view that absolute faith in an ultimate solution can hinder progress after a certain point,_ this is, in philosophy, the debate about two different meanings of the phrase that "Humans are perfectible." So in one meaning of that, it means that there is a perfect state that we can reach if we only do the right thing, like chant the right syllables or whatever, or a utopia, a perfect society that we can reach if only we kill the right people and so on. That notion of perfectibility leads to stagnation and tyranny. But the other notion of perfectibility, which is that improvement is always possible, which in some ways is equally optimistic, but in other ways is much more rational, is also true. And that's the sense of perfectibility that I argue for, that problems are always soluble. Problems are also inevitable. And that's why we really have no choice but to embark on an open-ended pursuit of knowledge and good explanations. *IN-LINE: So there's always room for improvement.* Yes.

So an auditory person could become visual if they were interested in doing so. The reason I think that would have been true is that we are general purpose knowledge creating machines.__

QUESTION: Why is advocating for multiverse quantum theory not dogmatic, or like a religious belief?
TIMESTAMP: [36:54](NO LINK&t=2214)
ANSWER: A line of criticism that is often heard, that the idea that quantum mechanics forces upon us the theory of parallel universes is a sort of religious theory because all that quantum mechanics can actually tell us is the outcomes of experiments. It can't actually prove that the mechanism by which these outcomes are brought about is as the theory says. So maybe it isn't and maybe there aren't these parallel universes. The trouble is that that is exactly the line which would let you say that the observations of the planets don't necessarily tell us that the Sun is at the center of the solar system. It could still be the Earth and that all that happens is that the light reaching the Earth is as if there were planets out there orbiting the Sun. This is exactly the argument that the results of quantum mechanics are just as if there were parallel universes producing them. Or to give a rather notorious topical example, it's like the people who say that fossils were put there exactly as if there had been dinosaurs that gave rise to them. But nobody has ever seen a dinosaur nor will anybody ever see the dinosaurs that produce the fossils and therefore it's a matter of religion to believe in them. But that is to misconstrue what science is about. Science is not about just predicting the outcomes of experiments. It is about understanding the world.

QUESTION: What is the significance of making mistakes in scientific research?
TIMESTAMP: [38:40](NO LINK&t=2320)
ANSWER: The pursuit of science is, as my old boss John Wheeler used to say, who was in Austin, Texas at the time when I worked with him, "Our whole problem is to make the mistakes as fast as possible." And in the book I say that it might help people to understand better the nature of the scientific process if we called scientific theories misconceptions right from the outset rather than only after we have discovered what's wrong with them. If we are going to expect continual improvement, we must expect that all our existing theories at least contain, although they contain a lot of truth, they also contain misconceptions and therefore in the final analysis are misconceptions. So we could talk about Einstein's misconception of gravity being a better misconception than Newton's misconception of gravity. Error is the natural and ubiquitous state of human minds. The only difference is whether we improve upon our errors or don't or refuse to. And if we want to improve upon them, we have to do these specific things involving criticism, seeking better explanations, seeking the truth, openness, tolerance, and so on.

QUESTION: Why is the ontological proof of God's existence, which involves the concept of infinity, a fallacy?
TIMESTAMP: [41:24](NO LINK&t=2484)
ANSWER: _Regarding Descartes" view that if you can imagine infinity, or if you can imagine an infinite being, that is a proof of the existence of God,_ I almost agree. It was certainly that proof, that purported proof, we call the ontological proof, I think, of the existence of God is a fallacy. And we can't blame the early philosophers for making that statement, because infinity wasn't properly understood until about the 19th century. Infinity is not only a thing about physics, like, for example, that there's an infinite number of points in a one-inch distance, which we now know how to make sense of statements like that. But it's also meaningful in mathematics, and it has been found that we can reason validly about infinity and deeply understand infinity in mathematics, too.

QUESTION: Is it possible that another civilization could help us understand the universe?
TIMESTAMP: [42:29](NO LINK&t=2549)
ANSWER: _Regarding whether it's possible that another civilization could help us understand the universe,_ here's another education theory point. __Whenever you understand something, it is you who have created the idea in your mind. It may feel as though somebody has poured it into you, like wine into a glass, but that is an illusion. All knowledge arises by conjecture and criticism. And what we do when we listen to somebody speaking, we don't download their theory into our brain. If we did, we wouldn't understand it.__ It would be like learning it in a foreign language. What we do is conjecture what it means, and then use what that person is saying as a means of criticizing and improving our conjecture. And with luck, we then find a way of understanding what that person is saying. And with even more luck, we find a way of improving on it.

QUESTION: Why are flowers objectively beautiful?
TIMESTAMP: [43:36](NO LINK&t=2616)
ANSWER: The conventional view of beauty is that it is purely subjective, or else purely cultural, that it has no objective basis. So when we say, it's a matter of taste, that's just another way in everyday language of saying there isn't any objective truth in it. But the thing about flowers is that the evolution of flowers had to solve a problem of how to make a signal of attractiveness that would be difficult to forge, but also easy to recognize by someone else who knew, in this case, insects, who knew the code. And so the insect-flower co-evolution produced a standard, which was an artistic standard, for what flowers should look like. Now my argument for why it hit on an objective standard is, if that was so, and there are plenty of examples of signaling in nature, but most of them don't look beautiful to humans. So the question is, why do flowers, which evolved to look attractive to insects, also look attractive to humans? And I make the argument in detail in the book that the only explanation for this is that to solve this problem of an interspecies signaling, the most efficient way of solving that problem was for both the insects and the flowers to evolve towards a criterion of objective beauty, which then appeal to humans as well, because humans are capable of understanding objective things.

But in that case, it would do you good to know the reason.
