QUESTION: What does the title of the book, The Beginning of Infinity, refer to?
TIMESTAMP: [0:52](NO LINK&t=52)
ANSWER: _Regarding the title of this book, The Beginning of Infinity,_ it's primarily the beginning of an infinity of knowledge, and that is to say that we're only just scratching the surface of what is possible for thinking beings like ourselves to understand. There's an intimate link then between understanding nature and controlling it. In fact, among other things, there is a spatial implication. We are going to spread out across space and throughout time, but the main thing is that we're going to spread out across the space of ideas, and there is, no the message of the book is that there's no fundamental limit to what we can understand and explain.

QUESTION: What's the difference between "pursuing truth or knowledge" and "pursuing explanations"?
TIMESTAMP: [1:53](NO LINK&t=113)
ANSWER: The only reason that one might avoid the words truth and knowledge, which I don't, is that they have traditionally been given very irrational meanings. Knowledge has been defined as that which you know for certain, and that sort of thing, and that's not available. But I, like the philosopher Karl Popper, whom I sort of follow in these matters, if you define knowledge as just being true and useful information, then we certainly can gain knowledge. But an explanation to me is a statement about reality, and a good explanation is a statement about reality that accounts for something and is hard to vary while still accounting for it. And that, I think, is the key difference between, let's say, science and pre-scientific ways of trying to understand the world, such as faith or myth.

QUESTION: You seem to subtly challenge religious explanations in your work; is this a deliberate approach to discredit religious beliefs?
TIMESTAMP: [3:30](NO LINK&t=210)
ANSWER: _Regarding my work being a "very cunning broadside against religion",_ I'm only interested in criticizing religion and such like things as explanations of, for example, the adaptations in living things. The religion may have other uses, such as cultural ones, which I have no real objection to. And as for broadside, I think that's not quite the right word, because __I made a decision just even before I wrote my first book that it's just going to take too much time to address all the reasons why all the wrong theories are wrong. And I'd rather make progress, because it's making progress that is really convincing to people. You never really convince people of anything by proving to them that their current ideas are wrong. They have to have somewhere to jump to, somewhere which is better by their own lights than their existing place. And therefore I want to show what I consider the true situation of the universe and our place in it and all that kind of thing is, and let people decide for themselves how they will change from mistaken views which have held us back.__

QUESTION: What did David Albert write in the New York Times book review of The Beginning of Infinity?
TIMESTAMP: [6:02](NO LINK&t=362)
ANSWER: _Regarding the excerpt from the New York Times review of your book in which David Albert writes, "It hardly seems worth saying to begin with that the chutzpah of this guy is almost beyond belief and that any book with these sorts of ambitions is necessarily in some overall sense a failure or a fraud or a joke or madness. But Deutsch, who is famous, among other reasons, for his pioneering contributions to the field of quantum computation, is so smart and so strange and so creative and so inexhaustibly curious and so vividly intellectually alive that it is a distinct privilege, notwithstanding everything, to spend time in his head.",_ David Albert and I have had many a debate on these issues. He's a great iconoclast. One of the themes that he particularly disputes was the many universes interpretation of quantum mechanics of which I'm a proponent. There are many instances of ourselves having this conversation and slightly different conversations. And the idea, our idea, is that this follows inexorably from our deepest theory of physics, namely quantum theory. But only a minority of physicists believe this. But the thing about David Albert is that he is the only physicist I know who was once a proponent of this and has then changed his mind.

ALTERNATE QUESTION: What is one of the topics that David Albert particularly disputes with David Deutsch?

QUESTION: How is the parallel universes interpretation different from a religious creation narrative?
TIMESTAMP: [7:18](NO LINK&t=438)
ANSWER: _Regarding multiverse quantum theory and the faith that God created the world in seven days as explanations,_ the difference is quite profound. The thing is that the parallel universes interpretation is really just a statement that quantum theory is a description of reality and isn't to be argued away as some kind of illusion or just a way of a description of how we perceive the world. It's not a description of humans, human minds, human experiences, but the equations literally describe the world. And so in that sense, it is purely a scientific theory and the objection to it is purely a bit of bad philosophy. It's the same bad philosophy that says that fossils are not evidence of dinosaurs because no one has ever seen dinosaurs. You might as well say that you couldn't challenge a paleontologist because he cannot prove that there ever were dinosaurs and you can't prove that there weren't. The logic of the denial that quantum theory is true is the same as the logic of the denial that evolution is true. The psychological motivations may be different, let me hasten to add, but the logic is the same. *IN-LINE: But do we have the same record of proof that a paleontologist would be able to offer up for the theory of evolution, moreover, that there were brachiosaurs and whatnot tromping all over the place at one time? Because he can hold up big bones, he can hold up fossils, and he can say, "There, in your face, dude."* Yes, well, we can hold, you see, the thing he's holding up isn't dinosaurs. And the thing that I'm holding up, namely interference phenomena, isn't parallel universes. But in both cases, the dinosaurs and the parallel universes respectively are the only known explanations of those bits of evidence. When I say explanations, I mean accounts of reality. So that's the sense in which I mean that the logic is the same.

QUESTION: In what sense do ideas exist?
TIMESTAMP: [9:49](NO LINK&t=589)
ANSWER: _Regarding in what sense do ideas exist,_ yes, I argue in the book that all sorts of abstract entities, like numbers and indeed ideas, do exist objectively. And the argument for that is that the causal effects of an idea are independent of the physical substrate in which they're instantiated. For example, the ideas that I'm telling you now begin as sort of electrical charges in neurons in my brain and then get translated into vibrations in air and then vibrations in, electrical vibrations in copper wires and so on. And the effect that it has has nothing to do with copper or air. You couldn't deduce them from any amount of study of copper or air. The thing that is having the causal effect and will make you now do one thing rather than another, you know, perhaps buy my book or whatever, is contained in the information, in the knowledge, which is an abstraction. It isn't the atoms that are making you do it. It's not the atoms that are now hitting your ear that are having that effect. It's the information that is embodied in them. *IN-LINE: Now, back in college, we used to get high and talk like this. We're making a living out of it.* Yes. Well, __it's a matter of whether one is critical. The ideas are always, always come by an undirected variation of existing ideas. And it could be that that's what getting high is. But the difference, what makes the difference between making progress with it and not making progress is the criticism afterwards.__

QUESTION: Why was the Enlightenment a unique moment in history?
TIMESTAMP: [12:08](NO LINK&t=728)
ANSWER: Oh, perhaps I understated what the Enlightenment was. I think the reason why the enlightenment is a sort of a one-off idea is that it is the Beginning of Infinity. It's not that everything happened at that time. In fact, scientific progress is happening much, much faster now than it did at the height of what is called the Enlightenment in the 18th century. But __what changed between the 18th century and the whole of human history before that, apart from a few attempted enlightenments that very tragically failed, is that they found a way of making sustained progress. And that was of having a tradition of criticism. For most of human history, those are two opposing concepts. Criticism is usually about preventing change and preventing criticism. But this magical thing, a tradition of criticism, if it can be stabilized, and it only has been stabilized once in history at the thing we call the enlightenment, is the beginning of an open-ended creation of knowledge exponentially growing indefinitely.__

QUESTION: What was the primary cause of the lack of progress during the dark ages?
TIMESTAMP: [13:34](NO LINK&t=814)
ANSWER: _Regarding what caused the lack of progress during the dark ages,_ I think __the external manifestations of repression, which hold back the growth of knowledge, are only ever a secondary effect, a sort of tidying up effect, tidying up the few ideas that manage to get through the primary effect, which is cultural.__ It's not that there were all sorts of ideas bristling up like they are today, but that they were then being suppressed. It's for the most part, it's that people were not having ideas. They did not think that problems were soluble. They thought that the situation of the world as they saw it was inevitable and unchangeable, and they thought that the only route to betterment was a supernatural one, and couldn't have happened on Earth anyway. So that's the difference.

QUESTION: Do you concur that scientific theories could be significantly revised or replaced with new evidence?
TIMESTAMP: [14:59](NO LINK&t=899)
ANSWER: _Regarding whether I may be way off if new information comes up,_ not only do I agree, I insist on that. The whole point of The Beginning of Infinity, in other words, that unlimited improvement is possible, is that even things that we consider incontrovertibly true today are eventually going to be improved upon. Not all of them, I mean we don't know which ones they are and which ones aren't, but there will be things that we consider incontrovertible today that will be improved upon tomorrow, and in science we have examples of this all the time. Cosmology has recently discovered that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and only a few years ago the debate was whether the universe was going to re-collapse or expand forever without accelerating, that it might accelerate was simply not on the cards. So a whole new kind of explanation was needed, and that gives us a whole new conception of cosmology.

QUESTION: Based on the idea that all problems are solvable, does this mean humanity will save the planet and fly to to other planets?
TIMESTAMP: [16:13](NO LINK&t=973)
ANSWER: _Regarding problems being soluble and whether that means we will save the planet and fly to to other planets,_ yes, it means that we can do this if we choose to, if we want to, and if we do it the right way, which is to understand that it is caused, that such things, improvements, are caused by the growth of knowledge. We need to maximize that at the expense of parochial details that might obsess us in the moment. *IN-LINE: Gosh, you make it sound so easy.* Very hard.
